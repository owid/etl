  "description": "Historians and demographers have gone to considerable trouble to reconstruct life expectancy in the past in individual countries.\nThis overview collects information from a large body of that work and links estimates for historical populations to those provided by \nthe United Nations, the World Bank, and other sources for 1950\u20132001. The result is a picture of regional and global life expectancy \nat birth for selected years from 1800 to 2001. The bibliography of more than 700 sources is published separately on the web.\n",

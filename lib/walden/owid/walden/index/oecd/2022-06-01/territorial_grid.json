  "description": "The OECD has classified two levels of geographic units within each member country: large regions (territorial level 2 or TL2) composed by 394 regions, and small regions (territorial level 3 or TL3) composed by 2 258 small regions in the OECD area. Small regions are further classified into two types of typology to help in assessing differences in socio-economic trends in regions, both within and across countries:\n\n- Urban/rural typology: traditionally the OECD has classified small regions as predominantly urban, intermediate, or predominantly rural regions.\n\n- Access to city typology: small regions are associated to a typology based on their level of access to metropolitan areas (densed and highly populated functionnal urban areas above 250 000 inhabitants).",

  "description": "To facilitate rapid downloads, the database has been organized into zipped data files. Two series of files are intended for different purposes and for different users.\nFor users who want to obtain all available data for an individual country or for all countries, the zipped data files labeled \"By country\" are recommended. The file \norganization follows internal practices and is not particularly user-friendly, but all publicly-available HMD data are included in this set.\nFor users who only want information of a given kind for all countries, the files \"By statistic\" are recommended. In this case the file organization is simpler, \nbut only certain parts of the database (i.e., items labeled \"Complete Data Series\" on country pages) are available in this format.\n\nMore details can be found at https://www.mortality.org/Data/ExplanatoryNotes.\n",

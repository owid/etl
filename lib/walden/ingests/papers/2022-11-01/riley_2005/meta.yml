  Historians and demographers have gone to considerable trouble to reconstruct life expectancy in the past in individual countries.
  This overview collects information from a large body of that work and links estimates for historical populations to those provided by 
  the United Nations, the World Bank, and other sources for 1950â€“2001. The result is a picture of regional and global life expectancy 
  at birth for selected years from 1800 to 2001. The bibliography of more than 700 sources is published separately on the web.

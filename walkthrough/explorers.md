# Walkthrough - Explorers

## Explorers step

Data explorers are Grapher charts expanded with additional functionalities to facilitate exploration, such as dynamic entity filters or customizable menus. They are powered by CSV files generated by ETL [served from S3](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces/owid-catalog?path=explorers/). Explorers data step in ETL is responsible for generating these CSV files. It works in the same way as e.g. garden step, but the transformations made there are meant to get the data ready for the data explorer (and not be consumed by users of catalog).

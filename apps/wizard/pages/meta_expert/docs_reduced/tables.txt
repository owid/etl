# `table`

A table groups indicators with a shared index. Its metadata attributes are defined by the `TableMeta` object in ETL.

## `table.common`

## `table.description`

*type*: `string` | recommended (often automatic)

Briefly describes the table for internal use or data catalog users. It should be a concise one or few paragraphs.

### Guidelines
        
- Begin with a capital letter and end with a period.
- Avoid mentioning other metadata fields (e.g., `producer`, `date_published`), except when essential for describing the data product.
- Use to provide a specific description if the automatic one (usually from the origin) is insufficient, such as for tables with multiple origins.

## `table.title`

*type*: `string` | required (often automatic)

A short title for the table for internal or catalog use.

### Guidelines
        
- Start with a capital letter; do not end with a period.
- Clearly identify the table.
- Override the automatic title (usually from the origin) if necessary, like for tables with multiple origins.

## `table.variables`

Indicators, or 'variables', are data point collections (typically time series) with metadata, defined by the `VariableMeta` object in ETL.

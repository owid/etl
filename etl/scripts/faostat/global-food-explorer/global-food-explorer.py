"""
This script takes three input files and combines them into a big explorer spreadsheet for the global food explorer.
The files are:
- (1) global-food-explorer.template.tsv: A template file that contains the header and footer of the spreadsheet, together with some placeholders.
- (2) foods.csv: a list of foods and their singular and plural names.
- (3) views-per-food.csv: a list of all available views for every food, including subtitle etc. The title can contain placeholders which are then filled out with the food name.
This is all further complicated by the fact that we have different tag for food products, which enable views with different columns, units and subtitles.
We take the cartesian product between (2) and (3) - according to the tag -, sprinkle some magic dust to make the titles work, and then place that massive table into the template (1).

NOTE: This script has been migrated and adapted from owid-content/scripts.

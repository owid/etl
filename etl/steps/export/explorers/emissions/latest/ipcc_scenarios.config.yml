The transformation of fossil fuels into their secondary form (such as electricity) results in large inefficiencies due to heat loss. This means primary energy is higher than the energy used by a population.

        Primary energy is the energy embodied in natural resources prior to transformation into useful end products. For example, the energy stored in coal or oil before combustion in a power plant. The transformation of fossil fuels into their secondary form (such as electricity) results in large inefficiencies due to heat loss. This means primary energy is higher than the energy used by a population.

      subtitle: |-
        Primary energy is the energy embodied in natural resources prior to transformation into useful end products. For example, the energy stored in coal or oil before combustion in a power plant. The transformation of fossil fuels into their secondary form (such as electricity) results in large inefficiencies due to heat loss. This means primary energy is higher than the energy used by a population.

        Secondary energy is the energy that is derived and transformed from its original form (called, primary energy) into a usable form. It is primary energy minus energy losses that have occurred in the transformation or raw fuels (such as coal or gas) into electricity, heat or liquid transport fuels.

      title: Primary energy from solar photovoltaic in the Middle East and Africa
      subtitle: |-
        Primary energy is the energy embodied in natural resources prior to transformation into useful end products. For example, the energy stored in coal or oil before combustion in a power plant. The transformation of fossil fuels into their secondary form (such as electricity) results in large inefficiencies due to heat loss. This means primary energy is higher than the energy used by a population.

        Final energy is the energy delivered to consumers for end consumption e.g. household electricity, or petrol sold at the pump. It is primary energy energy minus losses which occur in the transformation of fuels into usable energy products (giving us 'secondary energy') minus transmission and distribution losses of getting electricity or heat to the end user.

        Primary energy is the energy embodied in natural resources prior to transformation into useful end products. For example, the energy stored in coal or oil before combustion in a power plant. The transformation of fossil fuels into their secondary form (such as electricity) results in large inefficiencies due to heat loss. This means primary energy is higher than the energy used by a population.

        Primary energy is the energy embodied in natural resources prior to transformation into useful end products. For example, the energy stored in coal or oil before combustion in a power plant. The transformation of fossil fuels into their secondary form (such as electricity) results in large inefficiencies due to heat loss. This means primary energy is higher than the energy used by a population.

The transformation of fossil fuels into their secondary form (such as electricity) results in large inefficiencies due to heat loss. This means primary energy is higher than the energy used by a population.

      subtitle: |-
        Primary energy is the energy embodied in natural resources prior to transformation into useful end products. For example, the energy stored in coal or oil before combustion in a power plant. The transformation of fossil fuels into their secondary form (such as electricity) results in large inefficiencies due to heat loss. This means primary energy is higher than the energy used by a population.

      title: 'Projected change in cropland area: Adoption of healthy diets'
      subtitle: |-
        Projected change in cropland area by 2050 under a scenario of global adoption of healthier diets. Diets transition to the EAT-Lancet diet which is in line with healthy calorie and nutritional requirements. For richer countries this would mean a reduction (but not elimination) of meat consumption. For poorer countries, this would mean an increase.

        Projected change in cropland area by 2050 under a scenario where consumer food waste and food losses in supply chains are reduced by 25% by 2030 and 50% by 2050.

        Projected change in cropland area by 2050 under a scenario where crop yield gaps are closed. Yields increase linearly from current yields to 80% of the estimated maximum potential by 2050. Increasing yields above 80% is rarely achieved over large areas.

      subtitle: |-
        Projected change in cropland area by 2050 under a scenario where agricultural production and trade is optimized to produce food in the locations with the least risk of habitat loss. Agricultural production shifts from the 25 countries projected to have the greatest mean losses of suitable habitat across all species to countries where less than 10% of species are threatened with extinction.

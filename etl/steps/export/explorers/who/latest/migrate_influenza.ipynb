       " '2620805854952122498': '**Dataset Description:**\\\\n- FluID is a global human influenza surveillance dataset from the WHO that aggregates weekly data. Data comes from national influenza surveillance and regional networks such as EUROFlu.\\\\n- The WHO defines acute respiratory illnesses (ARIs) as sudden/acute onset of ≥1 of the following symptoms: cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, coryza, and were judged by a clinician to be due to an infection.\\\\n- The WHO defines influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) as acute respiratory infections with a fever ≥38ºC, a cough, and onset of symptoms within the last ten days.\\\\n- The WHO defines severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) as acute respiratory infections with a history of fever or measured fever of ≥38 C°, cough, with onset within the last ten days, requiring hospitalization.\\\\n- Some countries use older definitions of these conditions.\\\\n- Surveillance data from each country may come from sentinel sites, non-sentinel sites, or universal testing. However, the FluID dataset does not list the data under these separate categories, so we show them together.\\\\n- You can find more detail on the surveillance strategies, sampling methods, and definitions used by each country here: https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/352183/WHO-EURO-2022-4760-44523-63025-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y \\\\n\\\\n**Data preparation steps:**\\\\n- We remove values where the number of SARI cases is below the number of inpatients - by definition SARI cases should also be inpatients so there should always be more inpatients than SARI cases. \\\\n- We remove values where the number of ILIs or ARIs per 1000 outpatients is ≥ 1000.\\\\n- We remove values where the number of SARIs per 100 inpatients is ≥ 100.\\\\n- We remove all values for the time-series of ILIs or ARIs per 1000 outpatients where all values are ≤ 1 or ≥ 999.\\\\n- We remove all values for the time-series of SARIs per 100 inpatients where all values are ≤ 1 or ≥ 99.\\\\n- We calculate regional aggregates by summing count variables.\\\\n- We calculate monthly variables from weekly variables - all weeks commencing in a particular month are aggregated to that month.\\\\n- We remove all values for years with less than 10 data points.\\\\n- We do not show data for the most recent 21 days. Data covering the most recent 21 days is often adjusted and updated in the weeks following its release.'}"

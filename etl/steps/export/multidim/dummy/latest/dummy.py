"""This step shows various features of Collections. It is intended as a reference, so that you can start using most of the available features!


Some of the features include:
- Load other collections as dependencies! Use `paths.load_collectionset` to do so. Note that the dependencies must be defined in the DAG (just like it happens with data steps).
- Combine multiple collections int one. The example below combines two collections into one, and adds a new dimension (dropdown) to it so that one can switch between collections.
- Tweak the metadata around dimensions (dropdowns). For that, you should use the .config.yml file next to your script, and know the dimension slugs that you want to tweak. See what we have done in dummy.config.yml!

NOTE: Run this step with command `etlr multidim/dummy/latest/dummy --export --private --instant`

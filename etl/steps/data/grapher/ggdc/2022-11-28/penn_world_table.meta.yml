          Penn World Table is a database with information on GDP and its composition, employment, productivity and trade,
          covering 183 countries between 1950 and 2019.

          Data comes from national accounts, ICP PPP estimations, multiple other sources

        description_key:
          - This GDP per capita indicator provides information on economic growth and income levels in the medium run. Some country estimates are available as far back as 1950.
          - This data is adjusted for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries.
          - This data is expressed in international-$ at 2017 prices, using multiple benchmark years to adjust for differences in the cost of living between countries over time.
          - For GDP per capita estimates in the very long run, see the [Maddison Project Database's indicator](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-maddison).
          - For more up-to-date estimates of GDP per capita, see the [World Bank's indicator](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank).
        description_from_producer: Output-side real GDP at chained PPPs (in mil. 2017US$) [From GDP description]
        description_processing: |
          Estimated as the GDP (output, multiple price benchmarks) divided by the population of each country.

          This variable uses ICP PPP benchmarks from multiple years to correct for changing prices over time.

          Values for Bermuda have been replaced by estimates on GDP per capita (output, single price benchmark) due to the unusual changes on prices in this country.

          Values considered outliers from the original dataset (`i_outlier = "Outlier"`) have been excluded from the dataset, due to implausible relative prices (PPPs divided by exchange rates).

        title: Global investment in generative AI
        unit: 'constant 2021 US$'
        short_unit: '$'
        description_short: Generative AI refers to AI systems that can create new content, such as images, text, or music, based on patterns learned from existing data.

          - Reporting a time series of AI investments in nominal prices (i.e., without adjusting for inflation) means it makes little sense to compare observations across time; it is therefore not very useful. To make comparisons across time possible, one has to take into account that prices change (e.g., there is inflation).
          - It is not obvious how to adjust this time series for inflation, and we debated it at some length within our team.
          - It would be straightforward to adjust the time series for price changes if we knew the prices of the specific goods and services that these investments purchased. This would make it possible to calculate a volume measure of AI investments, and it would tell us how much these investments bought. But such a metric is not available. While a comprehensive price index is not available, we know that the cost for some crucial AI technology has fallen rapidly in price.
          - In the absence of a comprehensive price index that captures the price of AI-specific goods and services, one has to rely on one of the available metrics for the price of a bundle of goods and services. In the end we decided to use the US Consumer Price Index (CPI).
          - The US CPI does not provide us with a volume measure of AI goods and services, but it does capture the opportunity costs of these investments. The inflation adjustment of this time series of AI investments therefore lets us understand the size of these investments relative to whatever else these sums of money could have purchased.
        description_key:
          - Annual data points can be skewed by one-time events like major acquisitions, making trends hard to interpret.
          - Year-to-year changes likely reflect broader economic conditions like interest rates and market sentiment rather than AI-specific trends.
          - The data's methodology isn't fully clear about whether and how it captures important aspects of AI investment, including the activities of public AI-related companies (e.g., NVIDIA, TSMC), corporate internal R&D investments in AI, government funding and public sector investments, data center and infrastructure spending, hardware deployment and semiconductor manufacturing, and research and talent costs.
          - The categories shown (mergers, private investment, public offerings, minority stakes) suggest a focus on traditional corporate finance deals, but without a detailed methodology, we can't be certain about what's included or excluded.
          - The source is not clear about the extent to which investment figures cover infrastructure, computational power, and support services required to develop, deploy, and operationalize AI applications
          - For more information on how the costs to train frontier AI models are distributed refer to the article [How Much Does It Cost to Train Frontier AI Models?](https://epochai.org/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-train-frontier-ai-models) by EPOCH.
          - The total scale of AI investment across all possible channels may be significantly different from what's captured in this specific dataset.

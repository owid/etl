          Production: Crops and livestock products


          Original dataset description by FAOSTAT:

          Crop and livestock statistics are recorded for 278 products, covering the following categories: 1) CROPS PRIMARY:
          Cereals, Citrus Fruit, Fibre Crops, Fruit, Oil Crops, Oil Crops and Cakes in Oil Equivalent, Pulses, Roots and Tubers,
          Sugar Crops, Treenuts and Vegetables. Data are expressed in terms of area harvested, production quantity and yield.
          Cereals: Area and production data on cereals relate to crops harvested for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested
          for hay or harvested green for food, feed or silage or used for grazing are therefore excluded. 2) CROPS PROCESSED:
          Beer of barley; Cotton lint; Cottonseed; Margarine, short; Molasses; Oil, coconut (copra); Oil, cottonseed; Oil,
          groundnut; Oil, linseed; Oil, maize; Oil, olive, virgin; Oil, palm; Oil, palm kernel; Oil, rapeseed; Oil, safflower;
          Oil, sesame; Oil, soybean; Oil, sunflower; Palm kernels; Sugar Raw Centrifugal; Wine. 3) LIVE ANIMALS: Animals live
          n.e.s.; Asses; Beehives; Buffaloes; Camelids, other; Camels; Cattle; Chickens; Ducks; Geese and guinea fowls; Goats;
          Horses; Mules; Pigeons, other birds; Pigs; Rabbits and hares; Rodents, other; Sheep; Turkeys. 4) LIVESTOCK PRIMARY:
          Beeswax; Eggs (various types);  Hides buffalo, fresh; Hides, cattle, fresh; Honey, natural; Meat (ass, bird nes,
          buffalo, camel, cattle, chicken, duck,  game, goat, goose and guinea fowl, horse, mule, Meat nes, meat other camelids,

          cocoons, reelable; Skins (goat, sheep); Snails, not sea; Wool, greasy. 5) LIVESTOCK PROCESSED: Butter (of milk from
          sheep, goat, buffalo, cow); Cheese (of milk from goat, buffalo, sheep, cow milk); Cheese of skimmed cow milk; Cream
          fresh; Ghee (cow and buffalo milk); Lard; Milk (dry buttermilk,  skimmed condensed, skimmed cow, skimmed dried,

          Processing of possible data anomalies by Our World in Data:


          +The area harvested of spinach for China (which refers to mainland) in 1984 is missing. This causes that other regions
          that are aggregates which include China mainland have a spurious reduction in area harvested of spinach in that
          year, and a spurious increase in yield. Therefore, we remove those spurious aggregate values.


          +The amount of eggs produced per bird for Northern Europe (FAO) is unreasonably high before 1973, with values between
          50kg and 115kg, while from 1973 on it has more reasonable values, below 20kg. Therefore, we remove all values for
          Northern Europe (FAO) between 1961 and 1972.


          +Tea production in FAO data increased dramatically from 1990 to 1991 for many different countries (including some
          of the main producers, like China and India). However, data from 1991 was flagged as 'Estimated value' (while data
          prior to 1991 is flagged as 'Official figure'). This potentially anomalous increase was not present in the previous
          version of the data. Therefore, we removed tea production data (as well as per-capita production and yield) from
          1991 onwards.


          +Yields are unreasonably high (possibly by a factor of 1000) for some items, countries and years. For example, the
          yield of item 'Fruit Primary' in Denmark prior to 1985 is larger than 6000 tonnes/ha. Similar issues happen to Antigua
          and Barbuda and Burkina Faso. For Netherlands, a similar anomaly is found but prior to 1984 (which will be considered
          separately). Therefore, we remove these possibly spurious values.


          +Yields are unreasonably high (possibly by a factor of 1000) for some items, countries and years. This happens to
          item 'Fruit Primary' in Netherlands prior to 1984. Therefore, we remove these possibly spurious values.


          +Yields are unreasonably high (possibly by a factor of 1000) for some items, countries and years. This happens to
          item 'Locust beans (carobs)' for region 'Net Food Importing Developing Countries (FAO)'. Therefore, we remove these
          possibly spurious values.


          +Yields are unreasonably high (possibly by a factor of 1000) for some items, countries and years. This happens to
          item 'Walnuts, in shell' for region 'Eastern Asia (FAO)'. Therefore, we remove these possibly spurious values.


          +Yields are unreasonably high (possibly by a factor of 1000) for some items, countries and years. This happens to
          item 'Other tropical fruits, n.e.c.' for region 'Northern Africa (FAO)'. Therefore, we remove these possibly spurious
          values.


          +Yields are unreasonably high (possibly by a factor of 1000) for some items, countries and years. This happens to
          item 'Other tropical fruits, n.e.c.' for South America. Therefore, we remove these possibly spurious values.


          FAO does not provide data for the total number of slaughtered animals to produce meat. We calculate this metric
          by adding up the number of slaughtered animals of all meat groups. However, when data for slaughtered poultry (which
          usually outnumbers other meat groups) is not provided, we do not calculate the total (to avoid spurious dips in
          the data).

          Item: Cereals

          Description: Cereals are generally of the gramineous family and, in the FAO concept, refer to crops harvested for
          dry grain only. Crops harvested green for forage, silage or grazingare classified as fodder crops. Also excluded
          are industrial crops, e.g. broom sorghum (Crude organic materials nes) and sweet sorghum when grown for syrup (Sugar
          crops nes). For international trade classifications, fresh cereals (other than sweet corn), whether or not suitable
          for use as fresh vegetables, are classified as cereals. Cereals are identified according to their genus. However,
          when two or more genera are sown and harvested as a mixture they should be classified and reported as "mixed grains".
          Production data are reported in terms of clean, dry weight of grains (12-14 percent moisture) in the form usually
          marketed. Rice, however, is reported in terms of paddy. Apart from moisture content and inedible substances such
          as cellulose, cereal grains contain, along with traces of minerals and vitamins, carbohydrates - mainly starches
          - (comprising 65-75 percent of their total weight), as well as proteins (6-12 percent) and fat (1-5 percent). The
          FAO definitions cover 17 primary cereals, of which one - white maize - is a component of maize. Each definition
          is listed along with its code, botanical name or names, and a short description. Cereal products derive either from
          the processing of grain through one or more mechanical or chemical operations, or from the processing of flour,
          meal or starch. Each cereal product is listed after the cereal from which it is derived.


          Metric: Yield

          Description: Harvested production per unit of harvested area for crop products. In most of the cases yield data
          are not recorded but obtained by dividing the production data by the data on area harvested. Data on yields of permanent
          crops are not as reliable as those for temporary crops either because most of the area information may correspond
          to planted area, as for grapes, or because of the scarcity and unreliability of the area figures reported by the
          countries, as for example for cocoa and coffee. Source: FAO Statistics Division

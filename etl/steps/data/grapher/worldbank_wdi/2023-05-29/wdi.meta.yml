        title: Individuals using the Internet (% of population)
        description_short: Share of the population who used the Internet in the last three months.
        description_from_producer: >-
          Internet users are individuals who have used the Internet (from any location)
          in the last 3 months. The Internet can be used via a computer, mobile phone,
          personal digital assistant, games machine, digital TV etc.

          Limitations and exceptions: Operators have traditionally been the main source
          of telecommunications data, so information on subscriptions has been widely
          available for most countries. This gives a general idea of access, but a more
          precise measure is the penetration rate - the share of households with access
          to telecommunications. During the past few years more information on
          information and communication technology use has become available from
          household and business surveys. Also important are data on actual use of
          telecommunications services. Ideally, statistics on telecommunications (and
          other information and communications technologies) should be compiled for all
          three measures: subscriptions, access, and use. The quality of data varies
          among reporting countries as a result of differences in regulations covering
          data provision and availability.

          Discrepancies may also arise in cases where the end of a fiscal year differs
          from that used by ITU, which is the end of December of every year. A number of
          countries have fiscal years that end in March or June of every
          year.

          Statistical concept and methodology: The Internet is a world-wide public
          computer network. It provides access to a number of communication services
          including the World Wide Web and carries email, news, entertainment and data
          files, irrespective of the device used (not assumed to be only via a computer -
          it may also be by mobile phone, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access
          can be via a fixed or mobile network. For additional/latest information on
          sources and country notes, please also refer to:

        description_from_producer: |-
          Prevalence of stunting is the percentage of children under age 5 whose height for age is more than two standard deviations below the median for the international reference population ages 0-59 months. For children up to two years old height is measured by recumbent length. For older children height is measured by stature while standing. The data are based on the WHO's new child growth standards released in 2006.

An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the country plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.

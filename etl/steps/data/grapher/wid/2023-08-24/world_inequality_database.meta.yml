        description: "The share of income received by the richest 1%.\n\n            Income is ‘pre-tax’ — measured before taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received. It is, however, measured after the operation of pension schemes, both private and public.\n\n            \nThe data is estimated from a combination of household surveys, tax records and national accounts data. This combination can provide a more accurate picture of the incomes of the richest, which tend to be captured poorly in household survey data alone.\nThese underlying data sources are not always available. For some countries, observations are extrapolated from data relating to other years, or are sometimes modeled based on data observed in other countries.\n"

          - Stunting is when a child is significantly shorter than the average for their age.
          - Stunted growth is a consequence of poor nutrition and/or repeated infection.
          - These values are model estimates which account for sampling error around survey estimates and the data producer has made efforts to ensure the data is comparable over countries and time.

            subtitle: >-
              The share of children younger than five years old that are defined as stunted.
              [Stunting](#dod:stunting) is when a child is significantly shorter than the
              average for their age. It is a consequence of poor nutrition and/or repeated
              infection.

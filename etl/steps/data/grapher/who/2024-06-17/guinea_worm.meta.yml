      Elimination of [dracunculiasis[(#dod:guinea-worm)] is the confirmed absence of the emergence of adult female worms (the interruption of transmission of Dracunculus medinensis)
      in humans and animals for three consecutive years or longer from a country with such a low risk of reintroduction of the parasite that preventive measures
      could be reduced to a strict minimum.

          A case of guinea-worm disease is a person exhibiting a skin lesion with emergence of a Guinea worm,
          and in which the worm is confirmed in laboratory tests to be D. medinensis. That person is counted as a case
          only once during the calendar year, i.e. when the first worm emerges from that person.

      Elimination of [dracunculiasis[(#dod:guinea-worm)] is the confirmed absence of the emergence of adult female worms (the interruption of transmission of Dracunculus medinensis)
      in humans and animals for three consecutive years or longer from a country with such a low risk of reintroduction of the parasite that preventive measures
      could be reduced to a strict minimum.

          only once during the calendar year, i.e. when the first worm emerges from that person.

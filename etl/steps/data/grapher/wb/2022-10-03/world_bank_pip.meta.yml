          The Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP) is an interactive computational tool that offers users quick access to the World Bank’s estimates of poverty, inequality, and shared prosperity. PIP provides a comprehensive view of global, regional, and country-level trends for more than 160 economies around the world.

  income_consumption_pc: Depending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita. 'Per capita' means that the incomes of each household are attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).
  non_market_income: Non-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.
  processing_notes: |-
    For a small number of country-year observations, the World Bank PIP data contains two estimates: one based on income data and one based on consumption data. In these cases we keep only the consumption estimate in order to obtain a single series for each country.

    You can find the data with all available income and consumption data points, including these overlapping estimates, in our [complete dataset](https://github.com/owid/poverty-data#a-global-dataset-of-poverty-and-inequality-measures-prepared-by-our-world-in-data-from-the-world-banks-poverty-and-inequality-platform-pip-database) of the World Bank PIP data.

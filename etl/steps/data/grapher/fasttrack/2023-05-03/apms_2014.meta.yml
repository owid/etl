  title: Current depression in England by age and gender (APMS, 2014)
  description: This is a dataset of the prevalence of current depression in the general
    population in England, living in private households. Households were sampled randomly
    and individuals were interviewed using the revised Clinical Interview Schedule
    (CIS-R), which is a diagnostic structured interview format to determine whether
    people had common mental disorders in the past week. In this dataset, presence
    of a current episode of major depression was determined.

          The number of reported cases of guinea worm disease (dracunculiasis) as reported by the WHO.

          The WHO defines a case of guinea worm disease as the following:

          "A case of guinea-worm disease is a person exhibiting a skin lesion with emergence of a Guinea worm,
          and in which the worm is confirmed in laboratory tests to be Dracunculus medinensis. That person is
          counted as a case only once during the calendar year, i.e. when the first worm emerges from that person.
          All worm specimens should be obtained from each case patient for laboratory confirmation and sent to the
          United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All cases should be monitored at least twice
          per month during the remainder of the calendar year for prompt detection of possible emergence of additional guinea worms."

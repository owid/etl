  title: Online Index of Objects Launched into Outer Space (UN, 2023-09-29)
  description: >-
    This data is compiled from the Online Index of Objects Launched into Outer Space, maintained by the United Nations Office
    for Outer Space Affairs.


    Since 1962, the United Nations has maintained a Register of Objects Launched into Outer Space. Originally established
    as a mechanism to aid the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in its discussions on the political,
    legal, and technical issues concerning outer space, the evolution of international space law resulted in space object
    registration becoming a means of identifying which States' bear international responsibility and liability for space objects.


    The source indicates that around 87% of all satellites, probes, landers, crewed spacecraft, and space station flight elements
    launched into Earth orbit or beyond have been registered with the Secretary-General.


    In the data shown on our charts:

    - when an object is launched by a country on behalf of another one, it is attributed to the latter;

    - when a launch is made jointly by several countries, it is recorded in each of these countries' time series, but only
    once in the 'World' series.

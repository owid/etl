        title: Competitive elections
        description: >-
          The variable indicates whether the outcomes of elections are uncertain because their timing is not violated, voters
          are not systematically coerced, and election fraud is not consequential.


          It considers the incumbent changing after multi-party elections as a strong indicator, but neither necessary nor
          sufficient. It does not consider whether all contestants have access to funding and the media, and media coverage
          is unbiased.


          It matches the variable competitive_elections in Skaaning et al. (2015).

          In non-electoral autocracies, citizens do not have the right to elect the chief executive or the legislature.


          In one-party autocracies, some citizens have the right to choose the chief executive or the legislature, but only
          have one choice.


          Multiparty autocracies without an elected executive are otherwise one-party autocracies, but the chief executive
          of the government is not elected even if citizens have more than one choice in legislative elections.


          Multiparty autocracies are one-party autocracies in which citizens have more than one choice, though election outcome
          is certain.


          In exclusive democracies, citizens have the right to choose the chief executive and the legislature in multi-party,
          uncertain elections, but suffrage is restricted.


          Male democracies are exclusive democracies that have comprehensive suffrage for men.


          Electoral democracies are male democracies that also have comprehensive suffrage for women.

          The variable identifies the political regime of a country using the Lexical Index of Electoral Democracy by political scientists Svend-Erik Skaaning, John Gerring, and Henrikas Bartusevičius. It distinguishes between non-electoral autocracies (score 0), one-party autocracies (score 1), multi-party autocracies without elected executive (score 2), multi-party autocracies (score 3), exclusive democracies (score 4), male democracies (score 5), electoral democracies (score 6), and polyarchies (score 7).

          In non-electoral autocracies, citizens do not have the right to elect the chief executive or the legislature.

          In one-party autocracies, some citizens have the right to choose the chief executive or the legislature, but only have one choice.

          Multiparty autocracies without an elected executive are otherwise one-party autocracies, but the chief executive of the government is not elected even if citizens have more than one choice in legislative elections.

          Multiparty autocracies are one-party autocracies in which citizens have more than one choice, though election outcome is certain.

          In exclusive democracies, citizens have the right to choose the chief executive and the legislature in multi-party, uncertain elections, but suffrage is restricted.

          Male democracies are exclusive democracies that have comprehensive suffrage for men.

          Electoral democracies are male democracies that also have comprehensive suffrage for women.

          Polyarchies are electoral democracies that also protect the freedoms of expression, assembly, and association.

          It matches the variable lexical_index_plus in Skaaning et al. (2015).

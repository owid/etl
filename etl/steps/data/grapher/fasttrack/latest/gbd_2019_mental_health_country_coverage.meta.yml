  title: Countries with mental health data in GBD 2019
  description: |-
    Dataset showing the number of countries with primary data on the prevalence of mental illnesses. These were found after a systematic review, grey literature search and expert consultation, to identify studies with data on the prevalence of each mental illness.

    'The GBD inclusion criteria stipulated that: (1) the diagnostic criteria must be from 1980 onward; (2) “caseness” must be based on clinical threshold as established by the DSM, ICD, Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD), or diagnosed by a clinician using established tools; (3) sufficient information must be provided on study method and sample characteristics to assess the quality of the study; and (4) study samples must be representative of the general population (i.e., case studies, veterans, or refugee samples were excluded). No limitation was set on the language of publication.'

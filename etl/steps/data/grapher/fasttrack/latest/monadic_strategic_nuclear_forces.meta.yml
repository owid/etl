        description: >-
          The number of strategic nuclear warheads deliverable in first strike.


          Warheads designed for use away from the battlefield, such as against military bases, arms industries, or infrastructure
          and that could be carried by ballistic missiles, bombers, and submarines in one strike.

        title: nuclwarh_firststr_yield
        description: >-
          The number of megatons of strategic nuclear warheads deliverable in first strike.


          Strategic nuclear warheads designed for use away from the battlefield, such as against military bases, arms industries,
          or infrastructure and that could be carried by ballistic missiles, bombers, and submarines in one strike.


          Equivalent megatons, meaning that small warheads (equal or less than one megaton) are weighted more because they
          are relatively more destructive than large ones.
        unit: equivalent megatons
        short_unit: Mt
      nuclwarh_firststr_area:
        title: nuclwarh_firststr_area
        description: >-
          The area destroyable by strategic nuclear warheads deliverable in first strike.


          Strategic nuclear warheads designed for use away from the battlefield, such as against military bases, arms industries,
          or infrastructure and that could be carried by ballistic missiles, bombers, and submarines in one strike.


          Destroyable area in square kilometers, calculated by multiplying the equivalent megatonnage and the approximate
          area destroyed by one megaton (20 square miles), and then converting it into square kilometers.


          Approximate area destroyed by one megaton based on: Richelson, Jeffrey. 1980. Evaluating the Strategic Balance.
          American Journal of Political Science 24(4): 782.
        unit: square kilometers
        short_unit: km²

  title: Global maternal offspring loss - Smith-Greenaway et al. 2021
  description: This dataset shows survey data and estimates of maternal offspring loss across countries. This includes mothers
    who have lost an infant, child under 5 years old, or offspring. These are given as a rate per 1000 women in the age group.
    Underlying data comes from large-scale surveys (such as the Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster
    Surveys) conducted in many low- and middle-income countries. For countries lacking data, these are estimated using an
    indirect approach that combines formal kinship models and life-table methods in an additional 81 countries.

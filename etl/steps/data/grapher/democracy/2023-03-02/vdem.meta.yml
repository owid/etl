        description: |-
          The Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project publishes data and research on democracy and human rights.

          It acknowledges that democracy can be characterized differently, and measures electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian characterizations of democracy.

          The project relies on evaluations by around 3,500 country experts and supplementary work by its own researchers to assess political institutions and the protection of rights.

          The project is managed by the V-Dem Institute, based at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.

        description_key:
          - The index is mostly based on evaluations by around 3,500 experts, which are primarily academics and members of the media and civil society, and often are nationals or residents of the country. They therefore know the country’s political system well and can evaluate aspects that are difficult to observe.
          - We expand the coverage of the original data to include more years when current countries were still non-sovereign territories. We use the index score of the historical entity that they were part of, whenever available.
        description_from_producer: |-
          The index (`v2x_polyarchy`) is formed by taking the average of, on the one hand, the weighted average of the indices measuring freedom of association thick (`v2x_frassoc_thick`), clean elections (`v2xel_frefair`), freedom of expression (`v2x_freexp_altinf`), elected officials (`v2x_elecoff`), and suffrage (`v2x_suffr`) and, on the other, the five-way multiplicative interaction between those indices. This is half way between a straight average and strict multiplication, meaning the average of the two. It is thus a compromise between the two most well known aggregation formulas in the literature, both allowing partial "compensation" in one sub-component for lack of polyarchy in the others, but also punishing countries not strong in one sub-component according to the "weakest link" argument. The aggregation is done at the level of Dahl’s subcomponents with the one exception of the non-electoral component. The index is aggregated using this formula:

          `v2x_polyarchy = .5 ∗ MPI + .5 ∗ API`

          `= .5 ∗ (v2x_elecoff ∗ v2xel_frefair ∗ v2x_frassoc_thick∗ v2x_suffr ∗ v2x_freexp_altinf) + .5 ∗ ((1/8) ∗ v2x_elecoff + (1/4) ∗ v2xel_frefair + (1/4) ∗ v2x_frassoc_thick + (1/8) ∗ v2x_suffr + (1/4) ∗ v2x_freexp_altinf)`

        description_processing: |-
          We ingested the original data from the [V-Dem project website](https://v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/) and processed it with Stata.

          We expanded the years and countries covered by V-Dem. To include more of the period when current countries were still non-sovereign territories, we identified the historical entity they were a part of and used that regime’s data whenever available.

          For example, V-Dem only provides regime data since Bangladesh’s independence in 1971. There is, however, regime data for Pakistan and the colony of India, both of which the current territory of Bangladesh was a part. We, therefore, use the regime data of Pakistan for Bangladesh from 1947 to 1970, and the regime data of India from 1789 to 1946. We did so for all countries with a past or current population of more than one million.

          We calculated regional and global averages of the Electoral Democracy Index and its sub-indices, weighted and unweighted by population.

          - In _electoral autocracies_, citizens have the right to choose the chief executive and the legislature through multi-party elections; but they lack some freedoms, such as the freedoms of association or expression, that make the elections meaningful, free, and fair.
          - In _electoral democracies_, citizens have the right to participate in meaningful, free and fair, and multi-party elections.

          How can the political regime overall be classified considering the competitiveness of access to power (polyarchy) as well as liberal principles?


          0: Closed autocracy: No multiparty elections for the chief executive or the legislature.


          1: Electoral autocracy: De-jure multiparty elections for the chief executive and the
          legislature, but failing to achieve that elections are free and fair, or de-facto multiparty, or a
          minimum level of Dahl’s institutional prerequisites of polyarchy as measured by V-Dem’s
          Electoral Democracy Index (`v2x_polyarchy`).


          2: Electoral democracy: De-facto free and fair multiparty elections and a minimum level of
          Dahl’s institutional prerequisites for polyarchy as measured by V- Dem’s Electoral
          Democracy Index (`v2x_polyarchy`), but either access to justice, or transparent law
          enforcement, or liberal principles of respect for personal liberties, rule of law, and judicial as
          well as legislative constraints on the executive not satisfied as measured by V-Dem’s Liberal
          Component Index (`v2x_liberal`).


          3: Liberal democracy: De-facto free and fair multiparty elections and a minimum level of
          Dahl’s institutional prerequisites for polyarchy as measured by V- Dem’s Electoral
          Democracy Index (`v2x_polyarchy`) are guaranteed as well as access to justice, transparent
          law enforcement and the liberal principles of respect for personal liberties, rule of law, and
          judicial as well as legislative constraints on the executive satisfied as measured by V-Dem’s
          Liberal Component Index (`v2x_liberal`).


          Electoral democracies score above 2 on the indicators for multi–party
          (`v2elmulpar_osp`) and free and fair elections (`v2elfrfair_osp`), as well as above 0.5 on the
          Electoral Democracy Index (`v2x_polyarchy`). Liberal democracy meets the criteria for
          Electoral democracy but also satisfy the liberal dimensions by a score above 0.8 on the
          V–Dem Liberal Component index (`v2x_liberal`), as well as a score above 3 on transparent
          law enforcement (`v2cltrnslw_osp`), access to justice for men (`v2clacjstm_osp`) and women
          (`v2clacjstw_osp`). Electoral autocracies fail to meet one or more of the above–mentioned
          criteria of electoral democracies, but subject the chief executive and the legislature to de–jure
          multiparty elections as indicated by a score above 1 on the V–Dem multiparty elections
          indicator (`v2elmulpar_osp`). Closed autocracy if either no multiparty elections for the
          legislature take place (`v2xlg_elecreg == 0`) or the chief executive is not elected in direct or
          indirect multiparty elections. To identify whether this is the case, we take into account if
          there is no basic multiparty competition in elections (v2elmulpar_osp < 1) and the relative
          power of the Head of State (HoS) and the Head of Government (HoG) as well as the
          appointment procedures. The V–Dem variable `v2ex_hosw` identifies if the HoS (`v2ex_hosw`
          > 0.5) or HoG (`v2ex_hosw` < or equal to 0.5) is the chief executive. If the HoG is the chief
          executive, the variable `v2expathhg` indicates whether the HoG is directly (8) or indirectly (7)
          elected or appointed by the HoS (6). In the first case, we consider whether executive elections
          (`v2xex_elecreg == 0`) take place, in the second case whether legislative elections take place
          (`v2xlg_elecreg == 0`) and in the third case how HoS is selected as follows. The variable
          `v2expathhs` indicates whether the HoS is directly (7) or indirectly (6) elected. Thus, in the
          first case, we consider whether executive elections (`v2xex_elecreg`) take place, in the second
          case whether legislative elections take place and the legislature approves on HoG
          (`v2xlg_elecreg == 0` and `v2exaphog == 0`). This also applies for the cases if the HoS is the
          chief executive.


          [Text from [V-Dem Codebook v13](https://www.v-dem.net/documents/24/codebook_v13.pdf)]
        description_processing: |-
          We ingested the original data from the [V-Dem project website](https://v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/) and processed it with Stata.

          We expanded the years and countries covered by V-Dem. To include more of the period when current countries were still non-sovereign territories, we identified the historical entity they were a part of and used that regime’s data whenever available.

          For example, V-Dem only provides regime data since Bangladesh’s independence in 1971. There is, however, regime data for Pakistan and the colony of India, both of which the current territory of Bangladesh was a part. We, therefore, use the regime data of Pakistan for Bangladesh from 1947 to 1970, and the regime data of India from 1789 to 1946. We did so for all countries with a past or current population of more than one million.

          Finally, we make some additional minor changes to the coding rules. The two most consequential changes we make relate to RoW’s identification of whether a country’s chief executive is elected. One way RoW considers a chief executive to have been elected — even if they are not directly elected or appointed by the legislature — is if they are the head of state, they depend on the approval of the legislature, and there were multi-party elections for the executive. This last part is likely a coding error because to be consistent with RoW's other definitions, this should depend on multi-party legislative, not executive, elections. Only if the legislature has been chosen in multi-party elections does it make an otherwise unelected chief executive—who must be approved by that legislature—dependent on multi-party elections. We correct this error. Furthermore, RoW considers a chief executive to have been elected if the country had chosen both its legislature and executive in multi-party elections. But this considers some chief executives as elected even if they came to power through force after elections were previously held. Examples include the coup d’états led by Fulgencio Batista in Cuba in 1952 and by Muhammadu Buhari in Nigeria in 1983. We instead consider such chief executives as unelected.

        title: Women's political empowerment index
        description_short: Captures the extent to which women enjoy civil liberties, can participate in civil society, and are represented in politics. It ranges from 0 to 1 (most empowered).
        description_key:
          - The index scores each country on a spectrum, with some countries empowering women politically more than others. More specifically, this entails women's civil liberties, civil society participation and political participation.
          - _Women's civil liberties_ refers to women being free from forced labor, having property rights and access to the justice system, and enjoying freedom of movement (move unrestricted within, to, and from the country).
          - _Women's civil society participation_ refers to women being able to discuss political issues, participating in civil society organizations, and being represented among journalists.
          - _Women's political participation_ refers to women being represented in the legislature and having an equal share of political power.
        description_from_producer: >-
          Women’s political empowerment is defined as a process of increasing capacity for
          women, leading to greater choice, agency, and participation in societal decision-making. It
          is understood to incorporate three equally-weighted dimensions: fundamental civil liberties,
          women’s open discussion of political issues and participation in civil society organizations, and
          the descriptive representation of women in formal political positions.


          The index is formed by taking the average of women’s civil liberties index (`v2x_gencl`),
          women’s civil society participation index (`v2x_gencs`), and women’s political participation
          index (`v2x_genpp`).

          We ingested the original data from the [V-Dem project website](https://v-dem.net/data/the-v-dem-dataset/) and processed it with Stata.

          We expanded the years and countries covered by V-Dem. To include more of the period when current countries were still non-sovereign territories, we identified the historical entity they were a part of and used that regime’s data whenever available.

          For example, V-Dem only provides regime data since Bangladesh’s independence in 1971. There is, however, regime data for Pakistan and the colony of India, both of which the current territory of Bangladesh was a part. We, therefore, use the regime data of Pakistan for Bangladesh from 1947 to 1970, and the regime data of India from 1789 to 1946. We did so for all countries with a past or current population of more than one million.

          We calculated regional and global averages of the Women's Political Empowerment Index and its sub-indices, weighted and unweighted by population.

        description_key:
          - V-Dem’s experts consider the extent to which the government is recognized as the main authority and can assert its power over other actors if necessary. Such actors include insurgent groups, criminal organizations, and other countries. They also consider that some countries may be so weak their reach cannot cover remote areas.
          - V-Dem combines the experts’ ratings with supplementary information (the experts’ ratings of hypothetical countries, their stated uncertainties, and personal demographics) to produce best, upper-, and lower-bound estimates of the indicator.

          Over what percentage (%) of the territory does the state have effective control?


          With this question we seek to judge the extent of recognition of the preeminent
          authority of the state over its territory. We are not interested here in perfect control by the
          state, or whether it is relatively effective in comparison to other states, but an assessment of the
          areas over which it is hegemonic, e.g. where it is recognized as the preeminent authority and in
          a contest of wills it can assert its control over political forces that reject its authority. Several
          illustrative examples may help in this coding. During civil wars the claim of the state to rule is
          effectively neutralized by insurgent groups (e.g., the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka). There are also
          situations in which criminals or warlords exert control in contravention of state authority (e.g.
          opium growers in parts of Indochina). There are also cases of failed states where the central
          government cannot assert control over a share of its territory (e.g., contemporary Somalia).
          Here, we ask you to estimate the size of the territory that the state has effective control over,
          as a percentage (%) of the total territory that is officially part of the country.


          By "officially part of the country" we refer to international law. In cases where international
          law is not entirely clear, we refer you to general understandings. For example, China claims
          sovereignty over Taiwan, but it remains under the control of its own government. For purposes
          of this question, Taiwan should not be considered a failure to control its territory by the
          government of the PRC.

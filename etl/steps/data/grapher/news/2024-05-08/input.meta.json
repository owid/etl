The strategy for this indicator is based on first getting all the tags for a country, and then getting the number of articles that have those tags.\n\n\n1. Obtain all tags that concern a country:\n    - Obtain all the tag pages that have a title starting with a country name: a query like \"https://content.guardianapis.com/tags?web-title=spain\", for Spain. As a result we obtain a mapping that tells us for each country the list of tags (e.g. \"Spain: [world/spain, travel/spain, etc.]\") in use.\n    - We work with a list of ~240 countries.\n    - Getting the right country names has been an iterative process, trying to align our standard country names with the Guardian's.\n\n2. For each country, obtain the number of pages using each set of tags. Steps:\n    - For each country and year we get all content metadata: a query like \"https://content.guardianapis.com/search?tags=...&from-date=2020-01-01&to-date=2020-12-31\" for year 2020. The count of pages is in the property `response.total`.\n\nFor mor details, please refer to the snapshot script."

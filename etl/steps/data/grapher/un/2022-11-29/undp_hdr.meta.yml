          The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of achievements in three key dimensions of human development:
          A long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living.


          Measured by:


          - Life expectancy at birth

          - Mean years of schooling & Expected years of schooling

          - GNI per capita (in PPP adjusted international-$)


          The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions.

            - treated and disposed in situ;
            - stored temporarily and then emptied and transported to treatment off-site;
            - or transported through a sewer with wastewater and then treated off-site.

          Improved sanitation facilities include flush/pour flush to piped sewer system, septic tanks or pit latrines; ventilated improved pit latrines, composting toilets or pit latrines with slabs.

           Share of people who, in the past 12 months, had contact with a public official and paid or were asked for a bribe.
         description_key:
          - This indicator shows the share of people who had contact with a public official and paid a bribe or were asked for one in the past 12 months.
          - It measures everyday bribery between citizens and public officials, often called ‘administrative bribery’.
          - The indicator is the percentage of people who paid or were asked for a bribe, out of all those who had contact with public officials.
          - Public officials include people in legislative, executive, administrative, or judicial roles. Surveys use a standard list of officials and civil servants.
          - Bribery includes giving or being asked for money, gifts, or services in return for special treatment by a public official.
          - Data comes from household or victimisation surveys, usually carried out by national statistical offices or anti-corruption agencies.
          - Only the direct experiences of the person surveyed are counted, but bribes paid through intermediaries on their behalf are included.
          - The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) collects the data each year through the UN Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS).
          - The indicator provides an objective measure of bribery that can be compared between countries and over time.
          - Some surveys do not count cases where someone was asked for a bribe but refused to pay. This is expected to improve as survey standards are applied.
          - The indicator does not include other types of corruption, like abuse of power or bribery between businesses and officials.

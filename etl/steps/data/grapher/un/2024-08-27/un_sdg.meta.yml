          Indicator 6.2.1a tracks the proportion of population that is using an improved sanitation facility, which is not shared with other households, and where the excreta produced is either:

            - treated and disposed in situ;
            - stored temporarily and then emptied and transported to treatment off-site;
            - or transported through a sewer with wastewater and then treated off-site.

          Improved sanitation facilities include flush/pour flush to piped sewer system, septic tanks or pit latrines; ventilated improved pit latrines, composting toilets or pit latrines with slabs.

          - This measure tracks how common bribery is when citizens interact with public officials.
          - It shows the proportion of people who interacted with a public official in the past year and reported either paying a bribe or being asked to pay one.
          - Bribes include extra payments, gifts, or favors given in exchange for special treatment from government workers.
          - The focus is on everyday administrative bribery—the type most citizens face in routine interactions with public officials.
          - Public officials can hold a legislative, executive, administrative or judicial office, such as customs or police officers, judges, teachers or doctors.
          - It does not cover high-level political corruption, influence trading, or abuse of power.
          - Data is collected through national surveys. Respondents report only their own direct experiences, though cases involving middlemen are included. Indirect accounts from other household members are not.
          - Bribery usually leaves no trace in financial records or documentation. Surveys offer a practical approach for measuring these events.
          - Many surveys have historically excluded people who were asked for a bribe but refused to pay. This leads to underestimates and could be one reason for lower reported shares in earlier years. More countries are now using standardized methods to address this.

          This indicator is defined as the percentage of persons who paid at least one bribe (gave a public official money, a gift or counter favour) to a public official, or were asked for a bribe by these public officials, in the last 12 months, as a percentage of persons who had at least one contact with a public official in the same period.

          In the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), bribery is defined as: ‘Promising, offering, giving, soliciting, or accepting an undue advantage to or from a public official or a person who directs or works in a private sector entity, directly or indirectly, in order that the person act or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her official duties’ (ICCS Category 07031).

          This definition is based on definitions of bribery of national public officials, bribery of foreign public officials and official of international organisations and bribery in the private sector that are contained in the United Nations Convention against Corruption (articles 15, 16, and 21). While the concept of bribery is broader, as it includes also actions such as promising or offering, and it covers both public and private sector, this indicator focuses on specific forms of bribery that are more measurable (the giving and/or requesting of bribes) and it limits the scope to the public sector.

          The concept of undue advantage is operationalized by reference to giving of money (in addition to an official fee), gifts or provision of a service requested/offered by/to a public official in exchange for a special treatment. This indicator captures the often called ‘administrative bribery’, which is often intended as the type of bribery affecting citizens in their dealings with public administrations and/or civil servants.

          For this indicator, public official refers to persons holding a legislative, executive, administrative or judicial office.

          In the operationalization of the indicator, a list of selected officials and civil servants is used.

          Total government revenue as a proportion of GDP (%)

          #### Definition:

          Revenue is defined as an increase in net worth resulting from a transaction. It is a fiscal indicator for assessing the sustainability of fiscal activities.

          General government units have four types of revenue. The major types of revenue are taxes, social contributions, grants, and other revenue. Of these, compulsory levies and transfers are the main sources of revenue for most general government units.

          In particular, taxes are compulsory, unrequited amounts receivable by government units from institutional units.
          Social contributions are actual or imputed revenue receivable by social insurance schemes to make provision for social insurance benefits payable.
          Grants are transfers receivable by government units from other resident or non-resident government units or international organizations, and that do not meet the definition of a tax, subsidy, or social contribution.

          Other revenue is all revenue receivable excluding taxes, social contributions, and grants. Other revenue comprises: (i)
          property income; (ii) sales of goods and services; (iii) fines, penalties, and forfeits; (iv) transfers not elsewhere classified; and (v) premiums, fees, and claims related to non-life insurance and standardized guarantee schemes.

        description_from_producer: |-
          Proportion of domestic budgetary central government expenditure funded by taxes (%)

          #### Definition:
          Budgetary central government is an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, particularly the power to exercise control over many other units and entities.

          The budgetary central government is often a single unit of the central government that encompasses the fundamental activities of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget.

          The budgetary central government’s revenue (and expense) are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature.

          Most of the ministries, departments, agencies, boards, commissions, judicial authorities, legislative bodies, and other entities that make up the budgetary central government are not separate institutional units. This is because they generally do not have the authority to own assets, incur liabilities, or engage in transactions in their own right, including references to standards and classifications, preferably relying on international agreed definitions.

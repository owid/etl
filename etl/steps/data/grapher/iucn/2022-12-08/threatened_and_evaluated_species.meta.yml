        description: >-
          The IUCN Red List has assessed only a small share of the total known species in the world. This means the number
          of species threatened with extinction is likely to be a significant underestimate of the total number of species
          at risk.


          This is particularly true for understudied groups such as insects, plants and fungi.


          The share of known species threatened with extinction is only available for a few taxonomic groups where more than
          80% of species have been assessed.


          'Threatened' species are those that are categorized as 'Critically endangered', 'Endangered' or 'Vulnerable' on
          the IUCN Red List.

        description_key:
          - Since many species have not yet been described, this is a large underestimate of the total number of species in the world.
          - For a species to be formally described, it's description must be published in a scientific journal or book.
          - Species descriptions should fulfill several criteria specified by the relevant nomencalture code, including the selection of a type specimen,  a particular specimen formally associated with scientific name and description.
          - The values of the numbers of described species should be used with caution as these are not always be up to date for all taxonomic groups.
          - The source for each taxonomic group can be found in the [IUCN Red List summary statistics, Table 1a](https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/content/attachment_files/2023-1_RL_Table_1a.pdf).
          - The 'mushrooms' taxonomic group includes brackets, rusts, smuts and, jelly fungi.

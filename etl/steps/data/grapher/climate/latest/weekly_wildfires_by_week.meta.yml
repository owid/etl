    description_short: Cumulative area burnt by wildfires in hectares.
    description_key:
            - The cumulative area burnt by wildfires is determined using satellite imagery from high-resolution satellite imagery collected by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite), which are instrumental in detecting thermal anomalies and changes in landscape patterns indicative of burning. These satellite systems, equipped with advanced sensors, capture detailed images that enable precise estimation of burnt areas, even in remote and inaccessible regions.

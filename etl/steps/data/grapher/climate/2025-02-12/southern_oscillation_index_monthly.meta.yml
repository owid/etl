        title: Southern Oscillation Index (monthly)
        unit: ''
        short_unit: ''
        description_short: The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) is a measure of the atmospheric pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia. It is used as an indicator of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate pattern.
        description_processing: The SOI is calculated as the difference in normalized sea-level pressure between Tahiti and Darwin. A positive SOI indicates lower pressure in Tahiti and higher pressure in Darwin, which is associated with La Niña conditions. A negative SOI indicates higher pressure in Tahiti and lower pressure in Darwin, which is associated with El Niño conditions.
        description_key:
          - The SOI is used to monitor the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate pattern, which is the most important driver of climate variability on Earth.
          - The SOI is one of the oldest and most widely used indicators of ENSO.
          - The SOI is calculated as the normalized difference in sea-level pressure between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia.
          - The SOI is used to classify ENSO events as El Niño, La Niña, or neutral.

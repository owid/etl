  description: |-
    Life evaluations from the Gallup World Poll provide the basis for the annual happiness rankings. They are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll.

    This is called the Cantril ladder: it asks respondents to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale.

    The rankings are calculated by the source based on nationally representative samples for the three years surrounding the study year, so that data for 2021 will be made up of survey data from 2020-2022. The number of people and countries surveyed varies year to year, but by and large more than 100,000 people in 130 countries participate in the Gallup World Poll each year.

    The rankings are based entirely on the survey scores, using the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative.

    The Global Mobile Money Dataset is a set of global metrics for the mobile money industry based on data collected and analyzed by the GSMA Mobile Money program.

    The GSMA Mobile Money program considers services that meet the following definitions:

    • The service must be available to the unbanked, e.g., people who do not have access to a formal account at a financial institution.
    • The service must offer at least one of the following services: Storage of value; Domestic or international transfer; mobile payment, including bill payment, bulk disbursement, and merchant payment.
    • The service must offer a network of physical transactional points outside bank branches and ATMs, making the service widely accessible to everyone.
    • The service must offer an interface for initiating transactions for agents or customers that is available on mobile devices.
    • Mobile banking services that offer the mobile phone as just another channel to access a traditional banking product are not included.
    • Payment services linked to a traditional banking product or credit cards, such as Apple Pay and Google Wallet, are not included.

  description: IHME produced estimates and forecasts for 13 of the SDG indicators
    included in the Goalkeepers Report. To estimate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
    on the SDG indicators and their accompanying projections to 2030, IHME implemented
    an approach as shown in Figure 1 for capturing both the short-term effects of
    the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the long-term effects that reflect its impact
    on economic production, educational attainment, and development, and the consequences
    of these on the SDG indicators.

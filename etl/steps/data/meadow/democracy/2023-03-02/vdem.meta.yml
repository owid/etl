          In closed autocracies, citizens do not have the right to either choose the chief executive of the government or the legislature through multi-party elections.

          In electoral autocracies, citizens have the right to choose the chief executive and the legislature through multi-party elections; but they lack some freedoms, such as the freedoms of association or expression, that make the elections meaningful, free, and fair.

          In electoral democracies, citizens have the right to participate in meaningful, free and fair, and multi-party elections.

          In liberal democracies, citizens have further individual and minority rights, are equal before the law, and the actions of the executive are constrained by the legislative and the courts.

          It further includes intermediate categories for closed autocracies that may be electoral autocracies (score 1), electoral autocracies that may be closed autocracies (score 2), electoral autocracies that may be electoral democracies (score 4), electoral democracies that may be electoral autocracies (score 5), electoral democracies that may be liberal democracies (score 7) and liberal democracies that may be electoral democracies (score 8).

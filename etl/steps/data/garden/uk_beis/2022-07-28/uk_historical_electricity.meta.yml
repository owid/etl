  description: |
    Historical UK electricity data.
    Data on fuel input gives raw energy used for electricity generation. The actual electricity generated by those inputs is reduced (because of inefficiencies in the generation when burning fossil fuels).
    For this reason, a column of implied efficiency is included, which is obtained by dividing the input energy by the total electricity generation.

    - This chart shows monthly spending on the physical construction of data center buildings in the United States. It represents the actual value of work done at construction sites each month, including materials, labor, and contractor costs.
    - This data doesn't include maintenance work, land purchases, or the computer equipment that goes inside data centers (like servers and storage systems). This means it captures only a small part of total data center investment, since IT hardware represents a significant additional cost.
    - Data centers power a wide range of online services beyond AI, such as streaming services and cloud storage.
    - The values shown are not seasonally adjusted, meaning they reflect actual monthly spending and typical seasonal patterns, including slower winter construction and busier summer periods.

          - This indicator is adjusted for inflation using the Producer Price Index (PPI) for new office building construction. Following guidance from the [Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.census.gov/construction/c30/definitions.html), we assume data center construction costs are similar to office-type buildings because both use comparable structural components, such as foundations, walls, and HVAC systems.

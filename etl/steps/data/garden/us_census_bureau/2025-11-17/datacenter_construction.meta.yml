    - This shows monthly spending on the physical construction of data center buildings in the United States — the actual value of work done at construction sites each month. This includes materials, labor, and contractor costs.
    - The data doesn't include maintenance work, land purchases, or the computer equipment that goes inside data centers (like servers and storage systems). This means it captures only a small part of total data center investment, since IT hardware represents a significant additional cost.
    - Data centers run the full spectrum of internet services from shopping to streaming, not solely AI.
    - The values shown are not seasonally adjusted, meaning they reflect actual monthly spending including typical seasonal patterns such as slower winter construction or busier summer periods.

          - This indicator is adjusted for inflation using the Producer Price Index (PPI) for new office building construction. Following guidance from the [Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](https://www.census.gov/construction/c30/definitions.html), we assume data centre construction costs are similar to office-type buildings because both use comparable structural components, such as foundations, walls, and HVAC systems.

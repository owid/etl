    - This shows monthly spending on the physical construction of data center buildings in the United States — the actual value of work done at construction sites each month. This includes materials, labor, and contractor costs.
    - The data doesn't include maintenance work, land purchases, or the computer equipment that goes inside data centers (like servers and storage systems). This means it captures only a small part of total data center investment, since IT hardware represents a significant additional cost.
    - The values shown are not seasonally adjusted, meaning they reflect actual monthly spending including typical seasonal patterns such as slower winter construction or busier summer periods.

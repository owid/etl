        unit: "robots per 1,000 employees"
        description_key:
          - Industrial robots are machines used in factories to automate tasks like welding, assembly, and packaging.
          - They are defined as automatically controlled, reprogrammable, and multipurpose machines that can move in three or more directions.
          - Reprogrammable means their functions can be changed through software without altering their physical parts.
          - Multipurpose means they can be adapted for different tasks with mechanical changes.
          - Robots are becoming easier to install and more flexible, which means even small production runs can be automated.
          - Companies use robots to improve product quality, increase speed, reduce waste, and cut costs.

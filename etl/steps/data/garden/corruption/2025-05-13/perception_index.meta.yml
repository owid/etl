          The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) aggregates information from several sources that capture how business professionals and country experts perceive corruption in the public sector.

          To build the CPI, eligible data sources are first selected. A source qualifies only if it measures public‑sector corruption perceptions; relies on a sound, comparable scoring method; is produced by a credible institution; shows enough score variation to differentiate countries; covers a substantial number of nations; bases its ratings on the views of country experts or businesspeople; and is updated at least every two years. The current CPI draws on 13 data sets supplied by 12 separate institutions, each reflecting perceptions recorded during the preceding two years (the accompanying source‑description document details them).

          Next, every source is converted to a 0–100 scale, where 0 represents the highest perceived corruption and 100 the lowest. This standardisation subtracts the source’s baseline‑year mean from each country’s raw score and divides the result by that source’s baseline‑year standard deviation. The standardised value is then rescaled by multiplying by the CPI’s 2012 standard deviation (20) and adding the CPI’s 2012 mean (45), ensuring scores remain comparable across years while fitting the CPI’s 0–100 range.

          Finally, a country or territory enters the CPI only when at least three separate sources assess it. The country’s CPI figure is the arithmetic mean of all its available standardised scores, rounded to the nearest whole number.

        title: Corruption Perceptions Index
        unit: 0(highest)-100(lowest)
        description_short: A country’s score (0–100) represents an average of expert survey responses on perceived corruption in the public sector, including misuse of public office and bribery. (0 = most corrupt; 100 = least)
        description_key:
          - The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) scores and ranks countries and territories based on perceived levels of public-sector corruption, as assessed by experts and business executives.
          - It combines at least 3 and up to 13 independent data sources, which include expert assessments and business surveys conducted by reputable institutions.
          - Each source is standardized onto a 0–100 scale, where 0 indicates high perceived corruption and 100 indicates a very clean public sector.
          - A country’s CPI score is the simple average of the available sources for that year.
          - The methodology has been stable since 2012, enabling comparable year-to-year results since then.
          - The CPI applies a 90% confidence interval (margin of error) to account for variation across the data sources and possible inconsistencies in the assessments.
          - The CPI does not measure actual corruption directly, but rather the perceptions of public-sector corruption, as fully objective nationwide measures do not exist.

        title: Corruption Perceptions Index – Lower bound
        unit: 0 (highly corrupt) – 100 (very clean)
        description_short: Lowest likely value of a country’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) score, based on a 90% confidence interval.
        description_key:
          - The lower bound shows the lowest value a country’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) is likely to have, with only a 5% chance the true score is lower.
          - It is calculated by subtracting 1.645 times the standard error from the CPI score. The standard error reflects how much the individual data sources vary.
          - A wider gap between upper and lower bounds usually means greater disagreement between sources or fewer available data points.
          - Comparing whether the ranges of two countries overlap can help assess whether differences in scores reflect real differences or normal variation.
          - The number and mix of sources can change from year to year, which may cause the range to widen or narrow independently of changes in the underlying data on corruption.

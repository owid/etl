    The UN FAO publishes forest data as the annual average on 10- or 5-year timescales. The following year allocation applies: "1990" is the annual average from 1990 to 2000; "2000" for 2000 to 2010; "2010" for 2010 to 2015; "2015" for 2015 to 2020, and "2020" for 2020 to 2025.

    variables:
      _1a_forestarea:
        title: Forest area
        description_short: Forest area is land under natural or planted stands of trees of at least 5 meters in situ, whether productive or not, and excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems.
        unit: hectares
        short_unit: ha
        description_processing: Annual forest area values are linearly interpolated for missing years, based on available data points from the FAO Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) reports.
      _1d_expansion:
        title: Forest expansion
        description_short: Forest expansion is the sum of afforestation (the establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding) and natural forest expansion (expansion of forests through natural succession on land that, until then, was under another land use).
        unit: hectares per year
        short_unit: ha/year

      _1d_afforestation:
        title: Afforestation
        description_short: Afforestation is the establishment of forest through planting and/or deliberate seeding on land that, until then, was not classified as forest.
        unit: hectares per year

      _1d_nat_exp:
        title: Natural expansion
        description_short: Natural expansion refers to the increase in forest area due to natural processes such as seed dispersal and vegetative growth.
        unit: hectares per year
        short_unit: ha/year

      net_change_forest_area:
        title: Annual change in forest area
        description_short: Net change in forest area measures forest expansion (the sum of afforestation and natural expansion) minus deforestation.
        unit: hectares
        short_unit: ha
        description_processing: Annual forest area values are linearly interpolated for missing years, based on available data points from the FAO Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) reports.
      forestarea_share_global:
        title: Share of global forest area
        description_short: Share of global forest area represents the proportion of a country's forest area relative to the total global forest area.
        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
        description_processing: Annual forest area values are linearly interpolated for missing years, based on available data points from the FAO Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) reports.
      annual_change_forest_area_share:
        title: Annual change in forest area as share of forest area
        description_short: Annual net change in forest area measures forest expansion (the sum of afforestation and natural expansion) minus deforestation.
        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
        description_processing: Annual forest area values are linearly interpolated for missing years, based on available data points from the FAO Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) reports.
      annual_deforestation_share_forest_area:
        title: Annual deforestation as share of forest area
        description_short: Annual deforestation as share of forest area represents the yearly percentage of forest area lost due to deforestation relative to the total forest area.

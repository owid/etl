descriptions:
  gini: |-
    The Gini coefficient measures inequality on a scale from 0 to 1. Higher values indicate higher inequality.
  disposable_income: |-
    Income is ‘post-tax’ — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.
  market_income: |-
    Income is ‘pre-tax’ — measured before taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.
  gross_income: |-
    Income here is measured before taxes and after benefits.
  equivalization: |-
    Income has been equivalized – adjusted to account for the fact that people in the same household can share costs like rent and heating.
  additional_info: |-
    The entire population of each country is considered, and also the income definition is the newest from the OECD since 2012. For more information on the methodology, visit the [OECD Income Distribution Database (IDD)](http://www.oecd.org/social/income-distribution-database.htm).
  covid: |-
    Survey estimates for 2020 are subject to additional uncertainty and are to be treated with extra caution, as in most countries the survey fieldwork was affected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

        description: |
          The Palma ratio is a measure of inequality that divides the share received by the richest 10% by the share of the poorest 40%. Higher values indicate higher inequality.

        description: |
          P90 and P10 are the levels of income or consumption below which 90% and 10% of the population live, respectively. This variable gives the ratio of the two. It is a measure of inequality that indicates the gap between the richest and poorest tenth of the population.

          The P90/P50 ratio measures the degree of inequality within the richest half of the population. A ratio of 2 means that someone just falling in the richest tenth of the population has twice the median income or consumption.

  gini: &gini_description |
    The Gini coefficient is a measure of the inequality of the income distribution in a population. Higher values indicate a higher level of inequality.
  disposable_income: &disposable_income_description |
    Income here is measured after taxes and benefits.
  market_income: &market_income_description |
    Income here is measured before taxes and benefits.
  gross_income: &gross_income_description |
    Income here is measured before taxes and after benefits.
  equivalization: &equivalization_description |
    Income has also been equivalized â€“ adjusted to account for the fact that people in the same household can share costs like rent and heating.
  additional_info: &additional_info_description |
    The entire population of each country is considered, and also the income definition is the newest from the OECD since 2012. For more information on the methodology, visit the <href="http://www.oecd.org/social/income-distribution-database.htm">OECD Income Distribution Database (IDD)</href>
  covid: &covid_description |
    Survey estimates for 2020 are subject to additional uncertainty and are to be treated with extra caution, as in most countries the survey fieldwork was affected by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

        description:
          - P90 and P10 are the levels of income or consumption below which 90% and 10% of the population live, respectively. This variable gives the ratio of the two. It is a measure of inequality that indicates the gap between the richest and poorest tenth of the population.

        description: >-
          This estimates of the daily intake of antidepressants per 1000 people, calculated as the 'defined daily dose' â€“ the expected doses of antidepressants taken per 1000 people per day,
          according to the recommended dosages for each antidepressant. This enables us to compare overall levels of drug consumption, accounting for the fact that different antidepressants
          have different recommended dosages.

      _Definitions and methodology_


      This indicator presents available data at national level on the number of people experiencing
      homelessness as reported by public authorities in OECD and EU countries. Data are drawn from the
      2023 OECD Questionnaire on Affordable and Social Housing (QuASH 2023) and other available
      sources. Overall, homelessness data are available for 40 countries: all OECD countries except
      Hungary; and the following non-member countries: Croatia, Cyprus and Romania (Table HC 3.1.A1).


      Comparing homeless estimates across countries is difficult, as countries do not define or count the
      population experiencing homelessness in the same way. There is no internationally agreed definition
      of homelessness. Therefore, this indicator presents a collection of available statistics on homelessness
      in OECD, EU and key partner countries in line with national definitions, drawing on the ETHOS Light
      typology to the extent feasible (see Box HC 3.1).


      In general, the type of count can be differentiated between point-in-time counts and flow counts, which
      are defined below:


      - Point-in-time count: Data are collected at a single point-in-time, generally through a coordinated
      street count and/or an enumeration of people staying in shelters for people experiencing
      homelessness on a given night. Point-in-time counts thus present a “snapshot” of homelessness
      at a single time and place.


      - Flow count: Data are collected over a given period of time, such as the enumeration of all people
      who have stayed in a shelter over the course of the year.
      Point-in-time and flow data are not comparable, and are thus presented separately in this indicator. For
      additional discussion of the methodological challenges to homelessness data collection, see the section
      on Data and comparability issues below.


      _Data and comparability issues_


      _Significant methodological challenges stymy data collection on homelessness._


      _Definitional differences_


      As discussed above, differences in statistical definitions drive some of the variation in the reported
      incidence of homelessness across countries; these differences hamper international comparison and
      an understanding of the differences in homelessness rates and risks across countries. For instance,
      several countries that adopt a broader definition of homelessness report a higher incidence of
      homelessness, like Australia and New Zealand, relative to countries with a narrower definition, such as
      Chile, Portugal or Japan.


      However, definitional differences do not fully explain the variation in homelessness rates across
      countries: several countries with a broad definition of homelessness report among the lowest incidences
      of homelessness, such as Norway, Poland, Finland and Denmark. Figure HC3.1 (above) accounts for
      these definitional differences by presenting cross-country data on homelessness for ETHOS Light
      categories 1, 2 and 3 only.


      Different definitions of homelessness can co-exist within the same country, depending on the purpose
      and the collecting authority, producing considerable differences in homelessness estimates for the
      same territory. In the United States, for instance, the definition of homelessness used by the Department
      of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) – which is used to allocate federal funds to local authorities
      to address homelessness – is narrower than that used by the Department of Education (Evans, Phillips
      and Ruffini, 2019), which forms the basis of funding allocation to school districts to support children and
      youth experiencing homelessness. The result is two significantly different estimates of homelessness
      in the United States: while HUD estimated that over 580 000 people experienced homelessness on a
      single night in January 2022, the Department of Education reported 1.28 million children and youth
      nationally experienced homelessness at some point over the 2019-20 school year (this figure is
      exclusive of their parents) (US Interagency Council on Homelessness, 2024).


      _Limitations of data collection approaches_


      Beyond definitional differences, there are a number of challenges in the scope and methods of data
      collection that might affect measuring the full extent of homelessness (see the forthcoming OECD
      Monitoring Framework on Homelessness). Data on homelessness are typically based on the following
      collection methods, each with its strengths and limitations in terms of how well it captures different types
      of living situations:


      - Street counts: an estimate of the number of people sleeping rough at a point-in-time;


      - Service-based methods: information obtained from a broad range of service providers that
      support people experiencing homelessness;


      - Population censuses and Household surveys: a count or a sample of a given population at a
      point in time (e.g. Population Census; special module on homelessness in household survey);


      - Administrative data: records collected by different institutions/organisations (e.g., health data,
      criminal justice records, social services data, etc.) and used to extrapolate the number of people
      experiencing homelessness;


      - Advanced sampling methods: a statistical method, such as “capture-recapture,” comparing
      independent samples from two or more sources of data to estimate the total number of people
      experiencing homelessness;


      - By-name lists and Information management systems on homeless individuals: the collection of
      comprehensive demographic and identifying information on people experiencing
      homelessness, which may be collected via registry weeks.


      The type of housing solution of someone experiencing homelessness – whether it is a shelter or
      emergency accommodation service, temporary lodging with family or friends, or living out of a car or on
      the street – will be better reflected in some data collection methods relative to others. Further, the scope,
      design and implementation of each data collection approach varies widely, which can significantly affect
      the quality and coverage of the data. For instance, with respect to street counts, the geographic
      perimeter is not systematic across (or even within) countries. In addition to counting rough sleepers on
      public streets, street counts may (or may not) include parks, public transport, emergency rooms, parking
      garages or other places that, depending on the country context, may be used by rough sleepers.


      Moreover, in the case of service-based methods, there is no systematic approach to determining which
      types of services and emergency or temporary accommodation are included in data collection efforts,
      and which are left out. The selection of services to be surveyed may be narrowly defined (e.g., restricted
      to overnight shelters and temporary accommodation), or may be quite broad (e.g., to also include food
      banks, social service centres, health clinics, etc.). As a result, homelessness data resulting from
      service-based methods (often captured by ETHOS Light 2 and 3) are not fully comparable across
      countries. Table HC3.1.1 provides an overview of cross-country differences in the inclusion of children
      and temporary accommodation for specific groups in the national headline estimate of homelessness.


      Across 40 OECD and EU countries:

      - Over half (26 countries) include children under the age of 18 years;


      - Around 40% (17 countries) include temporary accommodation for victims of domestic violence;


      - Around 30% (12 countries) include temporary accommodation for refugees; and


      - Less than a quarter (9 countries) include temporary accommodation for asylum seekers.

  ethos_1: This data has been categorized within the European Typology of Homelessness and Housing Exclusion (ETHOS) typology as _ETHOS Light 1_. ETHOS Light 1 is defined as people living rough, living in the streets or public spaces without a shelter that can be defined as living quarters.
  ethos_2_3: This data has been categorized within the European Typology of Homelessness and Housing Exclusion (ETHOS) typology as _ETHOS Light 2 and 3_. ETHOS Light 2 is defined as people living in emergency accomodation, people with no place of usual residence who move frequently between various types of accommodation. ETHOS Light 3 is defined as people living in accommodation for the homeless, including hostels, temporary and transitional accommodation, and women's shelters or refuge accomodation.
  ethos_1_2_3: This data has been categorized within the European Typology of Homelessness and Housing Exclusion (ETHOS) typology as _ETHOS Light 1, 2 and 3_. It includes people living in the streets or public spaces, in emergency accomodation and in accommodation for the homeless, but it has not been dissagregated.

  point_in_time_count: This data is collected with a _point-in-time count_, in which data are collected at a single point in time, generally through a coordinated street count or an enumeration of people staying in shelters for people experiencing homelessness on a given night.

          As the data for the United Kingdom includes a count of households experiencing homelessness (instead of individuals), we have removed it to facilitate cross-country comparison.

          The data is originally presented in separate series rounds for each country, given different methodologies and aggregation levels considered. For this reason, these series rounds are not directly comparable. Due to visualization limitations, we have connected each country series. For more detailed analysis, you can check these survey rounds on the [OECD Affordable Housing Dataset website](https://www.oecd.org/housing/data/affordable-housing-database/housing-conditions.htm) (HC3.1 People experiencing homelessness).

          - Housing First models aim to provide tailored, intensive support for homeless people with high and complex needs by providing them with long-term, immediate housing and enabling them to exercise control over their support services.
          - Housing-led solutions are based on access to immediate, long-term housing solutions for people experiencing homelessness.

          The data is originally presented as two different classifications: whether countries have an active national strategy to combat homelessness, and whether Housing First or housing-led policies are in place. We combined these by considering that a Housing First or housing-led strategy exists when a national or regional strategy of that kind is in place. When there is no Housing First or housing-led strategy, but there is an active national or regional strategy, we consider that the country has another type of strategy in place (coded as "Other strategy"). When neither a national or regional strategy nor a Housing First or housing-led strategy is in place, we consider that the country has no strategy to address homelessness.

          For more information about these two classifications, please refer to the OECD report [National strategies for combatting homelessness](https://www.oecd.org/els/family/HC3-2-Homeless-strategies.pdf).

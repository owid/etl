      This dataset provides estimates of plastics use at the global level by polymer.


      Primary plastics use is estimated using regional consumption by application data from Ryberg et al. (2019). An assumption
      of the split by polymer by application is made that it is homogenous to the global values. Histroical values (pre-2015
      data) is extrapolated from 2015 data using the global evolution contained in Geyer, Jambeck and Law (2017). Secondary
      plastics use are derived using recycling rates and recycling loss rates, as described in the GPO annex. The plastics
      use data is associated with the economic flows in the OECD ENV-Linkages model to estimate changes over time. The total
      plastics use is equal to the sum of primary and secondary plastics use.

              This dataset provides estimates of plastics use at the global level by polymer.


              Primary plastics use is estimated using regional consumption by application data from Ryberg et al. (2019).
              An assumption of the split by polymer by application is made that it is homogenous to the global values. Histroical
              values (pre-2015 data) is extrapolated from 2015 data using the global evolution contained in Geyer, Jambeck
              and Law (2017). Secondary plastics use are derived using recycling rates and recycling loss rates, as described
              in the GPO annex. The plastics use data is associated with the economic flows in the OECD ENV-Linkages model
              to estimate changes over time. The total plastics use is equal to the sum of primary and secondary plastics

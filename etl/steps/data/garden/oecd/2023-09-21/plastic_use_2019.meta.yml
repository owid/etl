  title: Global Plastics Outlook - Plastics waste in 2019 by region, polymer and application
  description: >-
    This dataset provides estimates of plastics waste  per polymer and application for the 15 global regions of the OECD ENV-Linkages
    model, detailed in the Annex of the OECD Global Plastics Outlook.


    Plastic waste is calculated as a function of plastics use (in volumes), following Geyer, Jambeck and Law (2017), using
    a methodology based on lifespan distributions.

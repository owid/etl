  description: >-
    This dataset provides estimates of plastics waste for the 15 global regions of the OECD ENV-Linkages model, detailed in
    the Annex of the OECD Global Plastics Outlook.


    This dataset provides estimates of plastics waste per end-of-life fate after accounting for recycling losses and collected
    littering.


    Plastic waste is calculated as a function of plastics use (in volumes), following Geyer, Jambeck and Law (2017), using
    a methodology based on lifespan distributions. Plastic waste is divided into different waste management streams (end-of-life
    fates) by applying end-of-life shares that vary across countries and that account for account for recycling losses and
    collected litter. The methodology to derive the end-of-life shares is explained in the Annex to the OECD Global Plastics
    Outlook.

      description_snapshot: This dataset offers projections between 2019 and 2060 of plastic waste across 15 global regions
        separated by end-of-life fate. The calculations of plastic waste consider volumes of plastic use, accounting for losses
        through recycling and collected litter, based on the methodology by Geyer, Jambeck, and Law (2017). The waste is categorized
        into diverse management streams or end-of-life fates, factoring in variations in end-of-life shares across different
        countries.

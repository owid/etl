  title: Global Plastics Outlook - Plastics use by region - projections
  description: >-
    This dataset provides estimates of plastics use disaggregated by region for the baseline scenario.


    The plastics use data is associated with the economic flows in the OECD ENV-Linkages model to estimate changes over time.
    The total plastics use is equal to the sum of primary and secondary plastics use.

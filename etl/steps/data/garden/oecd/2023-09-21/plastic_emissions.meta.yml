    title: Global Plastics Outlook - Greenhouse gas emissions from primary plastics
    description: >-
      Greenhouse gases emissions are aggregated using 100-year global warming potential (GWP) from AR2 (IPCC, 1995)


      Emission coefficiens by stage and polymer or end-of-life fate are extrapolated from 2015 data using indexes. These indexes
      are built on scope-2 emissions intensity of primary and secondary plastics production (incl. upstream sectors) from
      the OECD ENV-Linkages model.

            description_snapshot: Greenhouse gas emissions are combined using a measurement called the 100-year Global Warming
              Potential (GWP), which comes from a 1995 report by the international climate science group, IPCC. Emissions
              are estimated at different stages, for different types of plastics, and when they are thrown away, based on
              data from 2015. These estimates are calculated using specific measures that consider the emissions created during
              the making of primary and secondary plastics, including those from related industries. These measures are taken
              from a model by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), ensuring a detailed and thorough
              analysis of emissions related to plastic production.

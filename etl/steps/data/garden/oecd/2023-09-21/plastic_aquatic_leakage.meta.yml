  description: >-
    This dataset provides estimates of plastics leakage for the 15 global regions of the OECD ENV-Linkages model, detailed
    in the Annex of the OECD Global Plastics Outlook.


    This database provides estimates for:

    - Leakage from mismanaged waste and litter to aquatic environments

    - Transport to oceans

    - Accumulated stock of plastics in rivers and lakes

    - Accumulated stock of plastics in oceans


    Plastic leakages to aquatic environments and the subcategory trasport to oceans are estimated by applying the methodology
    adapted from Lebreton and Andrady (2019), on OECD ENV-Linkages model outputs and plastic leakage from mismanaged and litter.
    The accumulated stock of plastics leakages in rivers and lakes corresponds to the net cumulative sum of leakages in rivers
    and lakes from 1951 onwards. The accumulated stock of plastics leakages in oceans corresponds to the net cumulative sum
    of leakages to oceans from 1951 onwards.

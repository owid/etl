      International aviation emissions are assigned to the country of departure. CO₂ emissions from commercial passenger flights only.

      Domestic aviation represents flights which depart and arrive within the same country. CO₂ emissions from commercial passenger flights only.
  desc_process_per_capita: &desc_process_per_capita |-
      CO₂ emissions per capita from aviation are calculated by dividing emissions from aviation by the total population of the country. This allows us to understand the average amount of CO₂ emissions attributed to each individual as a result of air travel.

    - CO₂ emission footprints do not necessarily reflect the amount of travel by locals in a given location. This is especially true if a country has high tourist volumes - much of the departures will result from travellers rather than local residents.

    - We have therefore also calculated 'adjusted' aviation footprints by multiplying per capita international CO₂ emissions by an adjustment factor.

    - This adjustment factor is taken as the ratio between outbound and inbound tourist trips.

    - A high ratio of outbound-to-inbound tourist trips indicates that a country receives less visitors than its residents travel abroad. This results in a relatively lower burden of emissions from international flights being allocated to the country whose residents don't travel internationally as frequently.

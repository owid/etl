  title: Air Transport CO2 Emissions
  description: The OECD Air Transport CO₂ Emissions database includes annual, quarterly, and monthly information on
    CO₂ emissions related to commercial passenger, freight, and general aviation flights,
    on both a territory and a residence basis, for 186 countries. These CO₂ emissions
    are estimated by the OECD, based on a consistent methodology across countries.


    OECD database is updated by the end of the first month of each quarter with new data from the previous quarter.

          International aviation emissions are assigned to the country of departure. The term "per capita" indicates that the emissions are calculated on a per-person basis, taking into account the total population of the country. By using this measurement, we can understand the average amount of CO₂ emissions attributed to each individual as a result of domestic air travel.


          Data on carbon dioxide emissions from aviation are sourced from the OECD Air Transport CO₂ Emissions database.


          Our World in Data has calculated per capita aviation emissions by dividing these values by population figures for each country.


          These per capita footprints do not necessarily reflect the amount of travel by locals in a given location. This is especially true if a country has high tourist volumes: much of the departures will result from travellers rather than local residents. We have therefore also calculated 'adjusted' aviation footprints by multiplying per capita international CO₂ emissions by an adjustment factor. This adjustment factor is taken as the ratio between outbound and inbound tourist trips sourced from United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO, 2023).  A high ratio of outbound-to-inbound tourist trips indicates that a country receives less visitors than its residents travel abroad. This results in a relatively lower burden of emissions from international flights being allocated to the country whose residents don't travel internationally as frequently.


          Note that when an individual visits/leaves a country multiple times within a year, each visit is counted as a separate trip.

  key_general_government: General government consists of central, state and local governments and social security funds.

  key_government_expenditure: General government expenditure includes goods and services consumed in a production process within the territory, compensation of employees, subsidies, property income, social benefits, capital transfers and investments, and other current expenditures.

  key_government_revenue: General government revenue includes taxes, net social contributions, and grants and other revenues.

  key_fiscal_balance: Fiscal balance is the difference between government revenues and expenditures. It is also referred to as net lending (+) or net borrowing (-) of general government.

  key_gross_debt: General government gross debt refers to the total amount a government owes, including all financial obligations that require future payments, such as loans and bonds, but excluding assets or investments the government owns. It does not include shares, equity, or financial derivatives.

  key_gross_debt_maastricht_definition: Under the Maastricht definition, gross debt is more narrowly defined, excluding pensions, financial derivatives, and other accounts payable, and is measured at nominal value rather than market value. It is named after the Maastricht Treaty, used to assess EU fiscal positions.

  key_government_investment: General government investment mainly includes gross fixed capital formation, which is infrastructure for transport, office buildings, housing, schools and hospitals. It also includes expenditures in research and development.

  key_government_net_interest_spending: Net interest spending is the difference between interest payments and interest receipts on general government debt. It is an inflexible part of public budgeting and has to be honoured to guarantee access to international financial markets and multilateral funds.

  key_government_primary_balance: The primary balance is the difference between revenues and expenditures, excluding interest payments. It is a measure of the government's capacity to meet its obligations without borrowing.

  key_government_structural_balance: The general government structural balance is a measure of the budget balance a government would have with its current policies if the economy was operating at its full potential ("potential GDP").

  key_government_structural_primary_balance: The structural primary balance is the primary balance adjusted for the impact of net interest payments on government debts.

  key_government_procurement_spending: General government procurement spending is the purchase of goods, services and works by the government. It is defined as the sum of the goods and services purchased by the government for its own use, gross fixed capital formation (infrastructure for transport, office buildings, housing, schools and hospitals), and social transfers in kind via market producers. Public corporations are excluded.

  key_expenditures_on_government_outsourcing: Expenditures on general government outsourcing is the portion of government production costs used to buy goods and services from entities outside the government. This includes goods and services used by the government, financed by the government, and other production costs.

  key_production_costs: Production costs of general government are public expenditures on the goods and services the government uses. These costs include wages for government employees and purchases of goods and services, like supplies for schools and hospitals. They do not include government spending that does not involve a purchase of a good or service, such as spending on social welfare, unemployment benefits, and other transfers. It also includes outsourcing, the costs of buying goods and services from entities outside of government, such as private companies and other agencies.

  key_tax_revenues: Tax revenues are the compulsory unrequited payments made by economic entities to the general government. They include taxes on consumption, income, wealth, property and capital.

  key_cofog: |-
    The Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) was defined by the OECD and adopted by other international organizations to classify government expenditures by the functions or purposes they serve. It defines ten different functions of government: general public services, defense, public order and safety, economic affairs, environmental protection, housing and community amenities, health, recreation, culture and religion, education, and social protection.

  key_function: |-

    General government expenditures data are from the
    OECD National Accounts Statistics (database), which
    are based on the System of National Accounts (SNA),
    a set of internationally agreed concepts, definitions,
    classifications and rules for national accounting. the
    2008 SNA framework has been implemented by all
    OECD countries. In SNA terminology, general
    government consists of central, state and local
    governments and social security funds. Expenditures
    encompass intermediate consumption, compensation
    of employees, subsidies, property income (including
    interest spending), social benefits, other current
    expenditures (mainly current transfers) and capital
    expenditures (capital transfers and investments).
    Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure
    of the value of the goods and services produced by
    a country during a period. Government expenditures
    per capita were calculated by converting total
    government expenditures to USD using the OECD/
    Eurostat purchasing power parities (PPP) for GDP
    and dividing by population of the country. PPP is the
    number of units of country B’s currency needed to buy
    the same quantity of goods and services in country A.

  description_from_producer_revenue: >-
    Revenues data are derived from the OECD National
    Account Statistics (database), which is based on the
    System of National Accounts (SNA). the SNA provides a
    set of internationally agreed concepts, classifications,
    definitions and rules for national accounting. The
    2008 SNA framework has been implemented by all
    OECD countries. In SNA terminology, general
    government is composed of central government,
    state government, local government, and social
    security funds. Revenues include taxes, net social
    contributions and grants and other revenues. Gross
    domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of
    the value of goods and services produced by a country
    during a period. Government revenues per capita
    were calculated by converting total revenues to USD
    using the OECD/Eurostat purchasing power parity
    (PPP) for GDP and dividing them by the population
    of the country. PPP is the number of units of country
    B’s currency needed to purchase the same quantity
    of goods and services in country A.

  description_from_producer_fiscal_balance: >-
    Fiscal balance data are derived from the OECD National
    Accounts Statistics (database), based on the System
    of National Accounts (SNA), a set of internationally
    agreed concepts, definitions, classifications and rules
    for national accounting. The 2008 SNA framework
    has been implemented by all OECD countries
    . Using SNA terminology, general government
    consists of central government, state government,
    local government and social security funds.


    Fiscal balance, also referred to as net lending (+) or net
    borrowing (-) of general government, is calculated as
    total government revenues minus total government
    expenditures. Revenues encompass taxes, net social
    contributions, and grants and other revenues.
    Expenditures comprise intermediate consumption,
    compensation of employees, subsidies, property
    income (including interest spending), social benefits,
    other current expenditures (mainly current transfers)
    and capital expenditures (i.e. capital transfers and
    investments).


    The primary balance is the fiscal balance excluding net
    interest payments on general government liabilities
    (i.e. interest payments minus interest receipts). Gross
    domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of
    the value of goods and services produced by a country
    during a period.

  description_from_producer_gross_debt: >-
    Data are derived from the OECD National Accounts
    Statistics (database) and the Eurostat Government
    Finance Statistics (database), which are based on the
    System of National Accounts (SNA). The 2008 SNA
    framework has been implemented by all OECD
    countries. Debt is defined as a specific
    subset of liabilities identified according to the types of
    financial instruments included or excluded. Generally,
    it is defined as all liabilities that require payment or
    payments of interest or principal by the debtor to
    the creditor at a date or dates in the future. All debt
    instruments are liabilities but some liabilities, such as
    shares, equity, and financial derivatives, are not debt.
    Debt is thus the sum of the following liability categories,
    whenever available/applicable in the financial balance
    sheet of the general government sector: currency and
    deposits, debt securities, loans, and other liabilities
    (i.e. insurance, pension and standardised guarantee
    schemes, other accounts payable and, in some cases,
    special drawing rights). According to the SNA, most
    debt instruments are valued at market prices, when
    appropriate (although some countries might not
    apply this valuation, particularly for debt securities).
    Countries’ treatment of government liabilities in
    respect of their employee pension plans varies,
    making international comparability difficult. Some
    OECD countries, such as Australia, Canada, Colombia,
    Iceland, New Zealand, Sweden and the United States,
    record employment-related pension liabilities, funded
    or unfunded, in government debt data. For those
    countries, the government debt ratio is adjusted by
    excluding these unfunded pension liabilities. Government debt
    here is recorded on a gross basis, not adjusted by
    the value of government-held assets. The SNA debt
    definition used here differs from the definition applied
    under the Maastricht Treaty, which is used to assess EU
    fiscal positions.

  description_from_producer_government_investment: >-
    Data are from the OECD National Accounts Statistics
    (database) based on the System of National Accounts
    (SNA), a set of internationally agreed concepts,
    definitions, classifications and rules for national
    accounting. The 2008 SNA framework has been
    implemented by all OECD countries.
    General government investment includes gross
    capital formation and acquisitions, less disposals of
    non-produced nonfinancial assets. Gross fixed capital
    formation (also called fixed investment) is the main
    component of investment. For government, it mainly
    consists of transport infrastructure but also includes
    infrastructure such as office buildings, housing,
    schools and hospitals. In the SNA 2008 framework,
    expenditures in research and development have
    also been included in fixed investment. Government
    investments together with capital transfers
    constitute the category of government capital
    expenditures. Government consists of central, state
    and local governments and social security funds.
    State government is only applicable to the nine
    OECD countries that are federal states: Australia,
    Austria, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Mexico, Spain
    (considered a quasi-federal country), Switzerland and
    the United States.

  description_from_producer_structural_balance: >-
    Data are derived from the OECD Economic Outlook (database). the structural fiscal balance, or
    underlying balance, represents the fiscal balance
    as reported in the System of National Accounts (SNA)
    framework adjusted for two factors: the state of the
    economic cycle (as measured by the output gap) and
    one-off fiscal operations. Potential GDP is not directly
    observable, and estimates are subject to substantial
    margins of error. One-off factors include both
    exceptional and irregular fiscal transactions as well
    as deviations from trend in net capital transfers. For
    more details, see [Sources and methods of the OECD
    Economic Outlook](www.oecd.org/eco/outlook/sourcesand-methods.htm).

  description_from_producer_structural_primary_balance: >-
    The general government structural primary balance is the
    primary balance adjusted for the impact of net interest
    payments on general government liabilities (i.e. interest
    payments minus interest receipts).

  description_from_producer_government_procurement_spending: >-
    The size of general government procurement
    spending is estimated using data from the OECD
    National Accounts Statistics (database), based on the
    System of National Accounts (SNA). General government
    procurement is defined as the sum of intermediate
    consumption (goods and services purchased by
    governments for their own use, such as accounting or
    information technology services), gross fixed capital
    formation (acquisition of capital excluding sales of
    fixed assets, such as building new roads) and social
    transfers in kind via market producers (purchases by
    general government of goods and services produced
    by market producers and supplied to households).
    Public corporations were excluded in the estimation of
    procurement spending.

  description_from_producer_expenditures_on_government_outsourcing: |-
    The concept and methodology of government outsourcing, which is also part of production costs, builds on the classification of government expenditures in the System of National Accounts (SNA). In detail, government outsourcing costs include: The goods and services used by government. In SNA terms, this includes intermediate consumption (procurement of intermediate products required for government production such as accounting or information technology services). The goods and services financed by government. In SNA terms, this includes social transfers in kind via market producers paid for by government (including those that are initially paid for by citizens but are ultimately refunded by government, such as medical treatments refunded by public social security payments).

  description_from_producer_production_costs: |-
    The concept and methodology of production costs builds on the classification of government expenditures in the System of National Accounts (SNA). In detail, government production costs include: Compensation costs of government employees including cash and in-kind remuneration plus all mandatory employer (and imputed) contributions to social insurance and voluntary contributions paid on behalf of employees. The goods and services used by government, which are the first component of government outsourcing. In SNA terms, this includes intermediate consumption (procurement of intermediate products required for government production such as accounting or information technology services). The goods and services financed by government, which are the second component of government outsourcing. In SNA terms, this includes social transfers in kind via market producers paid for by government (including those that are initially paid for by citizens but are ultimately refunded by government, such as medical treatments refunded by public social security payments). Other production costs, which include the remaining components of consumption of fixed capital (depreciation of capital) and other taxes on production less other subsidies on production.

  description_from_producer_tax_revenues: >-
    Data on revenues are computed from the OECD
    National Accounts Statistics (database), which are based
    on the System of National Accounts (SNA). the 2008
    SNA framework has been implemented by all OECD
    countries. Revenues include taxes
    (e.g. on consumption, income, wealth, property and
    capital), net social contributions (i.e. contributions for
    pensions, health and social security after deduction
    of social insurance scheme service charges, where
    applicable), sales of goods and services (e.g. market
    output of government establishments, entrance
    fees), and grants and other sources (e.g. current and
    capital grants, property income, and subsidies). These
    aggregates were constructed using sub-account
    items. The definitions of tax
    revenues differ between SNA and OECD Revenue
    Statistics, especially regarding compulsory social
    security contributions. In SNA, taxes are mandatory
    unrequited payments, in cash or in kind, made by
    institutional units to the government. Net social
    contributions are actual or imputed payments to
    social insurance schemes to make provision for
    social benefits to be paid. These may be compulsory
    or voluntary and funded or unfunded. OECD
    Revenue Statistics treat compulsory social security
    contributions as taxes, whereas the SNA considers
    them net social contributions because the receipt of
    social security benefits depends, in most countries,
    upon appropriate contributions having been made,
    even though the size of the benefit is not necessarily
    related to the amount of the contributions.

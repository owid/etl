     - This data isn’t seasonally adjusted—summer travel increases emissions, but the actual impact may be lower as Northern Hemisphere plants absorb more CO₂ during this time.

      Includes emissions from both domestic and international aviation. International aviation emissions are assigned to the country of departure. CO₂ emissions from commercial passenger flights only.

  desc_short_int: &desc_short_int |-
      International aviation emissions are assigned to the country of departure. CO₂ emissions from commercial passenger flights only.
  desc_short_dom: &desc_short_dom |-
      Domestic aviation represents flights which depart and arrive within the same country. CO₂ emissions from commercial passenger flights only.
  desc_process_per_capita: &desc_process_per_capita |-
      CO₂ emissions per capita from aviation are calculated by dividing emissions from aviation by the total population of the country. This allows us to understand the average amount of CO₂ emissions attributed to each individual as a result of air travel.

    - CO₂ emission footprints do not necessarily reflect the amount of travel by locals in a given location. This is especially true if a country has high tourist volumes - much of the departures will result from travellers rather than local residents.

    - We have therefore also calculated 'adjusted' aviation footprints by multiplying international CO₂ emissions by an adjustment factor.

    - This adjustment factor is taken as the ratio between outbound and inbound tourist trips.

    - A high ratio of outbound-to-inbound tourist trips indicates that a country receives less visitors than its residents travel abroad. This results in a relatively lower burden of emissions from international flights being allocated to the country whose residents don't travel internationally as frequently.

     note: Data on aviation emissions is missing for some countries, so actual global and regional emissions are higher. Regional emissions are shown to highlight trends over time and should not be compared.

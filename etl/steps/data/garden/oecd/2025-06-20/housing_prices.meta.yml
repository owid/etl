      price_to_income_ratio:
        description_short: Ratio of house prices to household disposable income per person, a measure for how affordable buying a home is. It is calculated as the ratio of the "nominal house price index" to "net household disposable income index".
        description_from_producer: Nominal house prices divided by nominal disposable income per head. Net household disposable income is used. The population data come from the OECD national accounts database.
      price_to_rent_ratio:
        description_short: Ratio of house prices to rent prices, used to compare the cost of buying versus renting a home. It is calculated as the ratio of the "nominal house price index" to the "rent index".
        description_from_producer: Nominal house prices divided by rent price indices.

        description_short: Ratio of house prices to income, compared to the long-term average (since 1980). The average is set to 100.
        description_from_producer: eNominal house prices divided by nominal disposable income per head. Net household disposable income is used. The population data come from the OECD national accounts database. The long-term average is calculated over the whole period available when the indicator begins after 1980 or after 1980 if the indicator is longer. This value is used as a reference value. The ratio is calculated by dividing the indicator source on this long-term average, and indexed to a reference value equal to 100.
      std_price_rent_ratio:
        description_short: Ratio of house prices to rent, compared to the long-term average (since 1980). The average is set to 100.
        description_from_producer: Nominal house prices divided by rent price indices. The long-term average is calculated over the whole period available when the indicator begins after 1980 or after 1980 if the indicator is longer. This value is used as a reference value. The ratio is calculated by dividing the indicator source on this long-term average, and indexed to a reference value equal to 100.

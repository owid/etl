  description: >
    The WHO Mortality Database hosts recorded cause-of-death data for each of the WHO member states. The share of deaths that are recorded varies between countries, from 90% of deaths recorded in some countries with fewer than 10% recorded in others.


    Causes of death are recorded according to the 10th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD10). 

    
    Deaths coded with ICD10 codes X85-Y09 (injuries inflicted by another person with intent to injure or kill), and ICD code Y87.1 (sequelae of assault), generally correspond to the definition of intentional homicide.

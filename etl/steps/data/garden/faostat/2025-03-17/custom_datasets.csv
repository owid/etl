The food balance sheet shows for each food item - i.e. each primary commodity and a number of processed commodities potentially available for human consumption - the sources of supply and its utilization. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of it. Data on per caput food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and - by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products - also in terms of caloric value and protein and fat content.","Food Balance Sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period.

Following the recommendation of experts gathered in the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) Round Table on hunger measurement, hosted at FAO headquarters in September 2011, an initial set of indicators aiming to capture various aspects of food insecurity is presented here. The choice of the indicators has been informed by expert judgment and the availability of data with sufficient coverage to enable comparisons across regions and over time. Many of these indicators are produced and published elsewhere by FAO and other international organizations. They are reported here in a single database with the aim of building a wide food security information system. More indicators will be added to this set as more data will become available. Indicators are classified along the four dimensions of food security -- availability, access, utilization and stability. For definitions of these indicators, see Definitions and standards below (under Item).","The Suite of Food Security Indicators presents the core set of food security indicators.

For some countries, the three subsectors of agriculture, forestry, and fishing are completely specified. In other cases, complete disaggregations are not available. The dataset also provides statistics on the total credit to all industries, indicators on the share of credit to agricultural producers, and an agriculture orientation index (AOI) for credit that normalizes the share of credit to agriculture over total credit by dividing it by the share of agriculture in gross domestic product (GDP). As such, it can provide a more accurate indication of the relative importance that banking sectors place on financing the sector. An AOI lower than 1 indicates that the agriculture sector receives a credit share lower than its contribution to the economy, while an AOI greater than 1 indicates a credit share to the agriculture sector greater than its economic contribution.","The Credit to Agriculture dataset provides national data for over 130 countries on the amount of loans provided by the private/commercial banking sector to producers in agriculture, forestry and fishing, including household producers, cooperatives, and agro-businesses.

        description: |
          Index of arable land needed to produce a fixed quantity of crops (where values in 1961 are equal to 1.0). This is calculated as arable land divided by the crop production index (PIN). The crop production index here is the sum of crop commodities produced (after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed). It is weighted by the commodity prices.

          This metric measures the index of arable land needed to produce a fixed quantity of crops (where values in 1961 are equal to 1.0).

          Arable land is the total of areas (extent of surface of land or water) under temporary crops, temporary meadows and pastures, and land with temporary fallow.  Arable land does not include land that is potentially cultivable but is not normally cultivated.

        title: "Daily caloric intake per person from animal products"
        unit: "kilocalories per day per capita"
        short_unit: "kcal"
        description: &macronutrient_composition_variable_description |
          The FAO provide annual figures from 1961 by country on daily caloric supply, fat supply (in grams),   and protein supply (in grams). To calculate the daily per capita supply of carbohydrates, we assume an energy density by macronutrient of 4 kcal per gram of both protein and carbohydrate and 9 kcal per gram of fat (based on established nutritional guidelines reported by the FAO). The daily supply of carbohydrates is therefore calculated as:

          ((Daily supply of kcal)-(Daily supply of protein * 4 + Daily supply of fat * 9)) / 4

          The quantity of calories from each macronutrient is then calculated based on the energy density figures given above (e.g. calories from protein is calculated by multiplying the daily supply of protein in grams by 4).

          For an explanation of these conversion factors, see "Chapter 3: Calculation Of The Energy Content Of Foods - Energy Conversion Factors", available at: http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/Y5022E/y5022e04.htm

          The share of calories derived from each macronutrient is then calculated by dividing the number of calories derived from a given macronutrient by the total daily caloric supply.

          Protein of animal origin includes protein supplied in the form of all meat commodities, eggs and dairy products, and fish & seafood.

        description: |
          Percentage change in surface area devoted to agriculture with respect to 10 years before. Negative values imply that surface area has decreased with respect to the previous decade.

          This data is used to assess which countries may have already peaked in their agricultural land use. 

          Assessing this by looking at annual land use data is difficult because there can be significant year-to-year variability. That land use for one or two years was lower than previous years would be insufficient to conclude that a country had peaked.

          For this reason we look at decadal changes in agricultural land. We look at land use in the latest year relative to 10 years before.

          If land use is lower in the latest year then we suggest that land use may have peaked. If land use it the same or higher than a decade back, we suggest that it hasn't, or this is uncertain.

          Hypothetical number of slaughtered animals worldwide if everyone in the world ate the same quantity as the average citizen of a given country.

          This is a hypothetical variable derived by Our World in Data which answers the question: "How many animals would need to be slaughtered if everyone in the world consumed the average per capita amount of a given country?". For example: "How many animals would need to be slaughtered if everyone in the world consumed the same amount of meat as the average UK citizen?".

          This was derived by multiplying global population by the per capita number of slaughtered animals of a given country.

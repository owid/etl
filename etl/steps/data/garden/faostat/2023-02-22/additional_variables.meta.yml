          Arable land is the total of areas (extent of surface of land or water) under temporary crops, temporary meadows and pastures, and land with temporary fallow.  Arable land does not include land that is potentially cultivable but is not normally cultivated.

        description: |
          Index of arable land needed to produce a fixed quantity of crops (where values in 1961 are equal to 1.0). This is calculated as arable land divided by the crop production index (PIN). The crop production index here is the sum of crop commodities produced (after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed). It is weighted by the commodity prices.

          This metric measures the index of arable land needed to produce a fixed quantity of crops (where values in 1961 are equal to 1.0).

          Arable land is the total of areas (extent of surface of land or water) under temporary crops, temporary meadows and pastures, and land with temporary fallow.  Arable land does not include land that is potentially cultivable but is not normally cultivated.

          Fish stock are subpopulations of a particular species of fish which have common parameters such as location, growth and mortality which define their population dynamics. Fish stocks are within biologically sustainable levels when fish catch does not exceed the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) - the rate at which fish populations can regenerate.

          This area is calculated as the cropland area that would be necessary if crop yields stagnated in 1961 (the total production on a given year divided by the crop yield of 1961), minus the true cropland area on a given year.

      energy_from_animal_products:
        title: "Daily caloric intake per person from animal products"
        unit: "kilocalories per day per capita"
        short_unit: "kcal"
        description: &macronutrient_composition_variable_description |
          The FAO provide annual figures from 1961 by country on daily caloric supply, fat supply (in grams),   and protein supply (in grams). To calculate the daily per capita supply of carbohydrates, we assume an energy density by macronutrient of 4 kcal per gram of both protein and carbohydrate and 9 kcal per gram of fat (based on established nutritional guidelines reported by the FAO). The daily supply of carbohydrates is therefore calculated as:

          ((Daily supply of kcal)-(Daily supply of protein * 4 + Daily supply of fat * 9)) / 4

          The quantity of calories from each macronutrient is then calculated based on the energy density figures given above (e.g. calories from protein is calculated by multiplying the daily supply of protein in grams by 4).

          For an explanation of these conversion factors, see "Chapter 3: Calculation Of The Energy Content Of Foods - Energy Conversion Factors", available at: http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/Y5022E/y5022e04.htm

          The share of calories derived from each macronutrient is then calculated by dividing the number of calories derived from a given macronutrient by the total daily caloric supply.

          Protein of animal origin includes protein supplied in the form of all meat commodities, eggs and dairy products, and fish & seafood.

Crops harvested green for forage, silage or grazingare classified as fodder crops. Also excluded are industrial crops, e.g. broom sorghum (Crude organic materials nes) and sweet sorghum when grown for syrup (Sugar crops nes). For international trade classifications, fresh cereals (other than sweet corn), whether or not suitable for use as fresh vegetables, are classified as cereals. Cereals are identified according to their genus. However, when two or more genera are sown and harvested as a mixture they should be classified and reported as ""mixed grains"". Production data are reported in terms of clean, dry weight of grains (12-14 percent moisture) in the form usually marketed. Rice, however, is reported in terms of paddy. Apart from moisture content and inedible substances such as cellulose, cereal grains contain, along with traces of minerals and vitamins, carbohydrates - mainly starches - (comprising 65-75 percent of their total weight), as well as proteins (6-12 percent) and fat (1-5 percent). The FAO definitions cover 17 primary cereals, of which one - white maize - is a component of maize. Each definition is listed along with its code, botanical name or names, and a short description. Cereal products derive either from the processing of grain through one or more mechanical or chemical operations, or from the processing of flour, meal or starch.

They are used mainly for human food (as such or in processed form), for animal feed and for manufacturing starch, alcohol and fermented beverages including beer. The denomination ""roots and tubers"" excludes crops which are cultivated mainly for feed (mangolds, swedes) or for processing into sugar (sugar beets), and those classified as ""roots, bulb and tuberous vegetables"" (onions, garlic and beets). It does include starch and the starchy pith and flour obtained from the trunk of the sago palm and the stem of the Abyssinian banana (Musa ensete). Certain root crops, notably bitter cassava, contain toxic substances, particularly in the skins. As a result, certain processes must be undertaken to make the product safe for human consumption. Apart from their high water content (70-80 percent), these crops contain mainly carbohydrates (largely starches that account for 16-24 percent of their total weight) with very little protein and fat (0-2 percent each). Methods of propagating root crops vary. A live potato tuber or seed must be planted but only part of the live yam tuber and a piece of the stalk (not the root) in the case of cassava. Production data of root crops should be reported in terms of clean weight, i.e. free of earth and mud. FAO distinguishes among seven primary root and tuber crops. The code and name of each one appears in the list that follows, along with its botanical name, or names, and a short description. The processed products of roots and tubers are listed together with their parent primary crops.",
00001723,faostat_qcl,Sugar Crops Primary,Sugar crops,"Sugar Crops and Sweeteners and derived products: In addition to providing the source for the manufacture of sugar, SUGAR CROPS are used to produce alcohol and ethanol. In certain countries, sugar cane is eaten raw in minor quantities. It also is used in the preparation of juices and for animal feed. There are two major sugar crops: sugar beets and sugar cane. However, sugar and syrups are also produced from the sap of certain species of maple trees, from sweet sorghum when cultivated explicitly for making syrup and from sugar palm. Sugar beets that are cultivated solely as a fodder crop and red or garden beets that are classified as vegetable crops are excluded from the FAO list of sugar crops. Sugar cane is a perennial grass (replanted at intervals using pieces of the cane stalks) that is cultivated mainly in the tropics. Sugar beet is an annual crop that is propagated by the seeds of the flowers. It is cultivated in cooler climates than sugar cane, mainly above the 35th parallel of the Northern Hemisphere. Both sugar beets and sugar cane have high water content, accounting for about 75 percent of the total weight of the plants. The sugar content of sugar cane ranges from 10 to 15 percent of the total weight, while that of sugar beets is between 13 and 18 percent. The protein and fat content of both beets and cane is almost nil. Production data on sugar beets and sugar cane relate to the harvested crop, free of soil, plant tops and leaves. FAO lists three primary sugar crops. Under the name SWEETENERS, FAO includes products used for sweetening that are derived from sugar crops, cereals, fruits or milk, or that are produced by insects. This category includes a wide variety of monosaccharide (glucose and fructose) and disaccharides (sucrose and saccharose). They exist either in a crystallized state as sugar, or in thick liquid form as syrups. The traditional sources of sugar are sugar cane and sugar beets. But in recent years, ever larger quantities of cereals (mainly maize) have been used to produce sweeteners derived from starch. OTHER DERIVED PRODUCTS. In addition to sugar, molasses is also obtained with various degrees of sugar content. The by-product obtained from the extraction of sugar is called bagasse in the case of sugar cane, and beet pulp in the case of sugar beets.",
00001726,faostat_qcl,"Pulses, Total",Pulses,"Pulses are annual leguminous crops yielding from one to 12 grains or seeds of variable size, shape and color within a pod. They are used for both food and feed. The term ""pulses"" is limited to crops harvested solely for dry grain, thereby excluding crops harvested green for food (green peas, green beans, etc.) which are classified as vegetable crops. Also excluded are those crops used mainly for oil extraction (e.g. soybean and groundnuts) and leguminous crops (e.g. seeds of clover and alfalfa) that are used exclusively for sowing purposes. In addition to their food value, pulses also play an important role in cropping systems because of their ability to produce nitrogen and thereby enrich the soil. Pulses contain carbohydrates, mainly starches (55-65 percent of the total weight); proteins, including essential amino acids (18-25 percent, and much higher than cereals); and fat (1 - 4 percent). The remainder consists of water and inedible substances. Production data should be reported in terms of dry clean weight, excluding the weightof the pods. Certain kinds of pulses can be skinned and partially crushed or split toremove the seed-coat, but the resulting products are still considered raw for classification purposes. FAO covers 11 primary pulses. Each is listed below, along with its code, its botanical name, or names, and a short description. Only two processed products are included in the FAO list, namely flour of pulses and bran of pulses.",
00001729,faostat_qcl,"Treenuts, Total",Treenuts,"Tree NUTS are dry fruits or kernels enclosed in woody shells or hard husks, which in turn are generally covered by a thick, fleshy/fibrous outer husk that is removed during harvest. Similar products, such as groundnuts, sunflower seeds and melon seeds, although often used for similar purposes, are included with oil-bearing crops.FAO includes in this group only dessert or table nuts. Nuts that are used mainly for flavouring beverages and masticatory and stimulant nuts should be excluded. An exception is made for areca nuts and kola nuts, which FAO considers to be inedible nuts, but which are included with the nut and derived products group to be consistent with international trade classifications. Nuts used mainly for the extraction of oil or butter, (e.g. sheanuts) as well as nuts contained in other fruits (e.g. peaches) are excluded. It should be noted that some countries report certain nut crops (chestnuts, pignolia nuts) with forestry products. Production data relate to the weight of nuts in the shell or husk, but without the outer husk. The weight of the kernel contained in the nut ranges from as low as 30 percent for cashew nuts to as high as 80 percent in the case of chestnuts. The edible portion of nut kernels is, with the major exception of chestnuts, very rich in fat content at between 50 percent and 65 percent. Protein content makes up 15-20 percent and carbohydrate content is between 10 percent and 15 percent. Starch and saccharose are the main components of dry chestnuts, accounting for about 75 percent. FAO covers ten primary nut crops. Each is listed below along with its code, its botanical name, or names, and a short description. NUT PRODUCTS include shelled nuts, whole or split, and further processed products, including roasted nuts, meal/flour, paste, oil, etc. Nut oils are not separately identified in the FAO classification; instead they are included under the heading ""oil of vegetable origin nes"". The most commonly marketed oils are almon oil and cashew nut oil and its derivative cardol.",
00001735,faostat_qcl,Vegetables Primary,Vegetables,"Vegetables, as classified in this group, are mainly annual plants cultivated as field and garden crops in the open and under glass, and used almost exclusively for food. Vegetables grown principally for animal feed or seed should be excluded. Certain plants, normally classified as cereals and pulses, belong to this group when harvested green, such as green maize, green peas, etc. This grouping differs from international trade classifications for vegetables in that it includes melons and watermelons, which are normally considered to be fruit crops. But, whereas fruit crops are virtually all permanent crops, melons and watermelons are similar to vegetables in that they are temporary crops. Chillies and green peppers are included in this grouping when they are harvested for consumption as vegetables and not processed into spices. FAO production data for green peas and green beans refer to the total weight including pods, although some countries report on a shelled weight basis. The weight of the pods ranges from 40 to 50 percent for peas to up to 70 percent for broad beans. Area data on small vegetable gardens are often omitted in agricultural surveys, although production estimates may be reported. Trade data for fresh vegetables also include chilled vegetables, meaning the temperature of the products has been reduced to around 0√∏C without the products being frozen. Vegetables contain principally water, accounting for between 70 percent and 95 percent of their weight. They are low in nutrients, but contain minerals and vitamins. FAO covers 27 primary vegetable products. Each is listed along with its code, botanical name, or names, and a short description. PRODUCTS DERIVED FROM VEGETABLES refer to processed products. Apart from a few main products, international trade classifications do not permit a sufficiently detailed classification of processed products according to the primary commodity used in the preparation. A similar situation prevails for frozen vegetables.",
00001738,faostat_qcl,Fruit Primary,Fruit,"Fruit Crops consist of fruits and berries that, with few exceptions, are characterized by their sweet taste. Nearly all are permanent crops, mainly from trees, bushes and shrubs, as well as vines and palms. Fruits and berries grow on branches, stalks or the trunks of plants, usually singly, but sometimes grouped in bunches or clusters (e.g. bananas and grapes). Commercial crops are cultivated in plantations, but significant quantities of fruits are also collected from scattered plants that may or may not be cultivated. Although melons and watermelons are generally considered to be fruits, FAO groups them with vegetables because they are temporary crops. Fruit crops are highly perishable. Their shelf life may be extended through the application of chemical substances that inhibit the growth of micro-organisms and through careful control of the surrounding temperature, pressure and humidity once the fruit has been picked. Fruits and berries have a very high water content accounting for some 70- 90 percent of their weight. They contain, in various degrees, minerals, vitamins and organic acids, some of which reside in the peel or skin. Some fruits have a high fibre content and other inedible components, so that wastage is high, e.g. 60 percent for passion fruit and 35-45 percent for pineapples. The waste in temperate zone fruit is lower, generally of the order of 10-15 percent, while berries contain very little waste. The carbohydrate content of fruits varies widely. Protein content is very low, averaging less than 1 percent, or below that in vegetables. Fat content in fruit is negligible, with the notable exception of avocados. Fruit crops are consumed directly as food and are processed into dried fruit, fruit juice, canned fruit, frozen fruit, jam, alcoholic beverages, etc. Fruit crops are not normally grown for animal feed, although significant quantities of diseased and substandard fruits, as well as certain by-products of the fruit processing industry, are fed to animals. Production data for fruit crops should relate to fruits actually harvested. Data on bananas and plantains should relate to the weight of single bananas or banana hands, excluding the weight of the central stalk. FAO lists 36 primary fruit crops.",

Fibres of animal origin (mainly wool and silk) are included with fibres of vegetal and animal origin. Milk and dairy products. Estimates of milk production as reported by countries refer to one or more of the following three concepts. Gross production is milk production plus milk sucked by young animals. Production available for consumption is net production less milk fed to animals, milk retained by farmers for food and feed, direct sales to consumers and farm waste. The FAO concept relates to net milk production. Data should be reported by kind of milking animal (cow, sheep, goat, etc.) in terms of whole milk and by weight. In most developed countries only 5-10 percent of whole milk is used directly for human consumption. The bulk of milk production is processed before being marketed as liquid milk (e. G. standardized, pasteurized, skimmed, etc.) or is manufactured in to products such as cream, butter, cheese, evaporated and condensed milk, milk powder, casein, yogurt, ice cream, etc. About 70 percent of whole milk is processed into dairy products; the by-products of these processes (e. G. skim milk, buttermilk and whey) are used either for feed or are manufactured into other dairy products, e. G. dry skim milk and low-fat cheese. Processed milk and dairy products are often supplemented with vitamins, mineral and various additives.

Non-domesticated animals are excluded under this definition unless they are kept or raised in captivity. Domestic animals included are large and small quadrupeds, poultry, insects (bees) and larvae of insects (silkworms). Figures on livestock numbers should refer to live animals enumerated on a given day or on several consecutive days. The FAO practice is that figures for an indicated year relate to animals reported by countries for any day between October of the previous year and September of the year indicated. Statistics on live animals by age, sex and utilization generally are not included in the list that follows, even though such breakdowns are extremely desirable in terms of national statistics. For each animal species FAO proposes that information be maintained on changes in national herds during the year according to the following equation: initial herd + animals born + imports of live animals - exports of live animals - natural losses - slaughter = closing herd.FAO defines meat as the flesh of animals used for food. In production data, meat is normally reported inclusive of bone and exclusive of meat that is unfit for human consumption. As reported by individual countries, meat production data may refer either to commercial production (meat entering marketing channels), inspected production (from animals slaughtered under sanitary inspection), or total production (the total of the above- mentioned categories plus slaughter for personal consumption). All FAO annual production data refer to total production.Country statistics on meat production adhere to one or more of the following concepts: 1. Live weight: the weight of the animal immediately before slaughter. 2. Killed weight: the live weight less the uncollected blood lost during slaughter. 3. Dressed carcass weight: weight minus all parts - edible and inedible - that are removed in dressing the carcass. The concept varies widely from country to country and according to the various species of livestock. Edible parts generally include edible offals (head or head meat, tongue, brains, heart, liver, spleen, stomach or tripes and, in a few countries, other parts such as feet, throat and lungs. Slaughter fats (the unrendered fats that fall in the course of dressing the carcasses) are recorded as either edible or inedible according to country practice. Inedible parts generally include hides and skins (except in the case of pigs), as well as hoofs and stomach contents.Among individual countries, one of the following three concepts issued to measure production:A. Production from all animals, of both indigenous and foreign origin, that are slaughtered within national boundaries. B. Production from the slaughter of indigenous animals plus exports of live indigenous animals during the reference period. Derived from meat production as follows: production from slaughtered animals plus the meat equivalent of all animals exported alive, minus the meat equivalent of all animals imported alive. As imports/exports of live animals are recorded by FAO in numbers, not weight, animal type and size are of significance. C. The biological production concept covers indigenous animals that are either slaughtered or exported live, plus net additions to the stock during the reference period. Derived from indigenous productions follows: indigenous production plus (or minus) the meat equivalent of the change in the stock numbers during the reference period. Production is expressed in terms of live weight. Changes in the total live weight of all animals are not taken into account.FAO uses the first concept of meat production in the construction of its food balance sheets and for related indicators. The second concept, indigenous meat production, in measuring the output of the national livestock sector, is useful mainly in the construction of index numbers of agricultural production. The third concept, biological production, would be the most complete as it also reflects changes in the livestock herd, but it is not used because of difficulties in obtaining information from national reporting offices. The prices applied to indigenous meat production are derived from prices of live animals. This covers not only the value of meat, but also the value of offals, fats, hides and skins.Beef and Veal, Dried, Salted, Smok Meat of bovine animals, whether salted, in brine, dried or smoked.

        - **Definition threshold varies**: A stillbirth generally refers to the birth of a baby showing no signs of life after a certain number of weeks of gestation, with the [ICD-11](https://icd.who.int/en) setting the cutoff at 22 weeks.
        - **Subcategories exist**: ICD-11 distinguishes between “early gestation stillbirth” (22–27 weeks) and “late gestation stillbirth” (28+ weeks).

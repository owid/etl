          during their whole lives to the fertility rates of a given period and if they were not subject to mortality. It is expressed as live births
          per woman. For age-specific fertility rates, it measuresmber of births to women in a particular age group, divided by the number of women in that age group. The age groups used are: 15-19, 20-24, ..., 45-49. The data refer to annual civil calendar years from 1 January to 31 December."

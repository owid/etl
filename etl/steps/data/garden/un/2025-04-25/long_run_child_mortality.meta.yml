          - What could be more tragic than the death of a young child? Child mortality, the death of children under the age of five, is still [extremely common](https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better) in our world today.
          - "The historical data makes clear that it doesn’t have to be this way: it [is possible](https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-big-problem-in-brief) for societies to protect their children and reduce child mortality to very low rates. For child mortality to reach low levels, many things have to go right at the same time: [good healthcare](https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare), [good nutrition](https://ourworldindata.org/hunger-and-undernourishment), [clean water and sanitation](https://ourworldindata.org/clean-water-sanitation), [maternal health](https://ourworldindata.org/maternal-mortality), and high [living standards](https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth). We can, therefore, think of [child mortality](https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality) as a proxy indicator of a country’s living conditions."
          - The chart shows our long-run data on child mortality, which allows you to see how child mortality has changed in countries around the world.
          - This variable measures the number of children who have died in a given year, who were under the age of five, divided by the number of newborns in a given year.
          - "This long-run indicator combines two data sources: Gapminder and the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME)."
          - "[Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd005/) provides estimates of child mortality rates for the years 1800 to 2015. The full range of sources used can be found in [their documentation](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd005/)."
          - The [UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME)](https://childmortality.org/all-cause-mortality/data) provides estimates of child mortality rates for some countries from 1932 onward.
          - For years where data from both sources is available, we prioritize the UN IGME data.

          This indicator is a combination of data from two sources:
            - Gapminder, which provides estimates of child mortality rates for the years 1800 to 2015.
            - The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME), which provides estimates of child mortality rates, available for some countries from 1932 onward.

          For years where data from both sources is available, we prioritize the UN IGME data.

          We calculate continental averages, but otherwise no alterations are made to the data.

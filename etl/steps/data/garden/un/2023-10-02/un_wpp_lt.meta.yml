      <% if type == "period" %>
      Period life expectancy is the average number of years a person is expected to live, based on mortality rates seen across all age groups in a given interval.
      <% elif type == "cohort" %>
      Cohort life expectancy is the average number of years that individuals born in a given interval actually lived, based on tracking that birth cohort over time.
      <% endif %>
    point_1: |-
      <% if type == "period" %>
      This is based on a synthetic cohort created using mortality rates across age groups in a given year.
      <% elif type == "cohort" %>
      Rather than waiting for the entire cohort to have died before calculating the cohort life expectancy, researchers may use data from birth cohorts that are 'almost extinct'.

    Abridged life tables up to age 100 by sex and both sexes combined providing a set of values showing the mortality experience of a hypothetical group of infants born at the same time and subject throughout their lifetime to the specific mortality rates of a given year (period life tables), from 1950 to 2021.

      central_death_rate:
        title: Central death rate
        description_short: |-
          For a given population or cohort, the central death rate during a given 12 month interval is calculated as the number of deaths during the interval, divided by the number of person-years lived during that interval.
        description_key:
          - |-
            Person-years refers to the combined total time that a group of people has lived. For example, if 10 people each live for 2 years, they collectively contribute 20 person-years. This makes the value very slightly different from the 'probability of death' during the interval, because the 'probability of death' metric uses a different denominator: the number of people alive at that age at the start of the interval.
        unit: deaths per 1,000 people
        processing_level: minor
        description_processing: |-
          The original metric is given as a fraction between 0 and 1 (i.e. per-capita). We multiply this by 1,000 to get a per-1,000 people rate.
      probability_of_death:
        title: Probability of death
        unit: "%"
        description_short: |-
          The probability of dying in a given interval, among people who survived to the start of that interval.
        description_key:
          - |-
            For example, the probability of death for a 50 year old in a given year is found by: dividing the number of deaths in 50 year olds that year, by the number of people alive at the age of 50 at the start of the year.
        processing_level: minor
        description_processing: |-
          The original metric is given as a fraction between 0 and 1 (i.e. per-capita). We multiply this by 100 to get a percentage.
      probability_of_survival:
        title: Probability of survival
        unit: "%"
        description_short: The probability that a person who survived until the start of a given interval will have died by the end of the interval.
        processing_level: minor
        description_processing: |-
          The original metric is given as a fraction between 0 and 1 (i.e. per-capita). We multiply this by 100 to get a percentage.

          The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) is a summary measure of key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, a good education, and a decent standard of living, adjusted for inequalities in these dimensions. Higher values indicate higher and more equal human development.
        description_key:
          - The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) adjusts the Human Development Index (HDI) for inequality in the distribution of each dimension across the population.
          - It is based on a distribution-sensitive class of composite indices proposed by Foster, Lopez-Calva and Szekely (2005), which draws on the Atkinson (1970) family of inequality measures. It is computed as a geometric mean of inequality-adjusted dimensional indices.
          - The IHDI accounts for inequalities in HDI dimensions by "discounting" each dimension's average value according to its level of inequality. The IHDI value equals the HDI value when there is no inequality across people but falls below the HDI value as inequality rises. In this sense the IHDI measures the level of human development when inequality is accounted for.
          - Data is originally sourced from UNDESA complete life tables (health), harmonised household-survey micro-datasets (education) and the UNU-WIDER WIID (income).

        description_key:
          - Compares female and male achievements in health, education and command over economic resources by taking the ratio of the female HDI to the male HDI; a value of 1 denotes gender parity, while values below (above) 1 indicate disadvantage for women (men).
          - It highlights how much human development potential is lost to gender disparities and guides gender‑responsive budgeting.
          - "The Gender Development Index (GDI) measures gender inequalities in achievement in three basic dimensions of human development: health, measured by female and male life expectancy at birth; education, measured by female and male expected years of schooling for children and female and male mean years of schooling for adults ages 25 years and older; and command over economic resources, measured by female and male estimated earned income."
          - Values below 1 indicate higher human development for men than women, while values above 1 indicate the opposite. Values close to 1 therefore indicate higher gender equality.

          Adjustment of the Human Development Index (HDI) for planetary pressures in the Anthropocene. It discounts the HDI for pressures on the planet to reflect a concern for inter-generational inequality, similar to the Inequality-adjusted HDI adjustment, which is motivated by a concern for intra-generational inequality.
        description_key:
          - The Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI) discounts the HDI by an adjustment factor based on a country's carbon-dioxide emissions and material footprint, yielding the level of human development achieved when planetary pressures are taken into account.
          - The PHDI is computed as the product of the HDI and (1 - index of planetary pressures), where (1 - index of planetary pressures) can be seen as an adjustment factor.
          - The PHDI is the level of human development adjusted by carbon dioxide emissions per capita (production) and material footprint per capita to account for the excessive human pressure on the planet.
          - The PHDI should be seen as an incentive for transformation. In an ideal scenario, with no pressures on the planet, the PHDI equals the HDI.
          - However, as pressures increase, the PHDI falls below the HDI. In this sense the PHDI measures the level of human development when planetary pressures are considered.

        description_key:
          - The Human Development Index (HDI) provides a broad, intuitive measure for comparing overall human progress across countries and over time. A higher HDI implies longer, healthier lives, better education and higher command over resources; however, it does not capture inequality, sustainability or subjective wellbeing
          - |-
            It is a composite summary of a country's average achievement in three basic dimensions of human development – health (life expectancy), knowledge (schooling) and material wellbeing (GNI per capita) – combined through a geometric mean into a single 0‑to‑1 score.
          - |-
            Each dimension of the HDI is captured by a specific index:
              - **Healthy life**: Captured by the _Life Expectancy Index_, which is based on life expectancy at birth.
              - **Good education (knowledge)**: Captured by _Education Index_, which is based on the expected and mean years of schooling.
              - **Decent standard of living**: Captured by _Gross National Income (GNI) Index_, which is based on the GNI per capita (PPP$).
          - |-
            The index is estimated by normalizing and aggregating the above indicators. First, the indicators are brought onto the same scale, ranging from 0 to 1. This is done by setting minimum and maximum values for each indicator. The minimum and maximum values for each indicator are defined as follows:
              - Life expectancy at birth ranges between 20 and 85 years
              - Expected years of schooling between 0 and 18 years; Mean years of schooling, between 0 and 15 years
              - GNI per capita between 100 and 75,000 international-$ at 2021 prices.

          - The HDI is then estimated as the geometric mean of these indices. The education index is the arithmetic mean (average) of the mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling.
        description_from_producer: |-
          The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and having a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions.

          The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of schooling for children of school entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The HDI uses the logarithm of income, to reflect the diminishing importance of income with increasing GNI. The scores for the three HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a composite index using geometric mean. Refer to Technical notes for more details.

          The HDI can be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes. These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.

          The HDI simplifies and captures only part of what human development entails. It does not reflect on inequalities, poverty, human security, empowerment, etc. The HDRO provides other composite indices as broader proxy on some of the key issues of human development, inequality, gender disparity and poverty.

          A fuller picture of a country's level of human development requires analysis of other indicators and information presented in the HDR statistical annex.

          - It reflects the total number of years of schooling from primary to tertiary education that a child can expect to receive based on current enrollment patterns.
          - Acts as the forward‑looking component of the HDI education dimension, signalling a country's commitment to invest in human capital for the next generation.
          - This indicator assumes that current age-specific enrollment rates will persist throughout the child's years of schooling, providing a snapshot of educational access and opportunity.
          - The calculation includes all levels of education and accounts for the likelihood of enrollment at each age based on current patterns.

        description_key:
          - Serves as the attainment component of the HDI education dimension, complementing “expected years” to balance past and future schooling achievements.
          - The average years of schooling measures the educational attainment of the adult population, reflecting the accumulated human capital in a country.
          - Formal education is primary/ISCED 1 or higher.
          - The measure is calculated based on educational attainment data from censuses and household surveys, where adults report their highest completed level of education.
          - It ignores education quality, informal learning and younger cohorts; sensitive to outdated census rounds in data‑poor settings.

          UNDP relies on IMF (2023), UNDESA (2023), United Nations Statistics Division (2023), World Bank (2023).

          The World Bank's 2023 World Development Indicators database contains estimates of GNI per capita in constant 2021 purchasing power parity (PPP) terms for many countries. For countries missing this indicator (entirely or partly), the Human Development Report Office calculates it by converting GNI per capita in local currency from current to constant terms using two steps. First, the value of GNI per capita in current terms is converted into PPP terms for the base year (2021). Second, a time series of GNI per capita in 2021 PPP constant terms is constructed by applying the real growth rates to the GNI per capita in PPP terms for the base year. The real growth rate is implied by the ratio of the nominal growth of GNI per capita in current local currency terms to the GDP deflator.

          For several countries without a value of GNI per capita in constant 2021 PPP terms for 20 22 reported in the World Development Indicators database, real growth rates of GDP per capita available in the World Development Indicators database or in the International Monetary Fund's Economic Outlook database are applied to the most recent GNI values in constant PPP terms.

          Official PPP conversion rates are produced by the International Comparison Program, whose surveys periodically collect thousands of prices of matched goods and services in many countries. The last round of this exercise refers to 2021 and covered 176 economies.

          - The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) educational attainment dataset shows the educational composition of the population aged 25 years and above and hence the stock and quality of human capital within a country.
          - The dataset also reflects the structure and performance of the education system and its accumulated impact on human capital formation.

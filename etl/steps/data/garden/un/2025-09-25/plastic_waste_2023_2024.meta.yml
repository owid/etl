  # Reusable description components
  hs_classification: &hs_classification "Data covers plastic waste classified under HS code 3915 ('waste, parings and scrap, of plastics') in UN Comtrade trade statistics. This includes waste from different polymer types such as polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)."
  all_transport_modes: &all_transport_modes "Data includes all transport methods: air, sea, road, rail, inland waterways, and cases where the transport mode was not specified."
  per_capita_explanation: &per_capita_explanation "Per capita values enable comparisons between countries of different population sizes."
  trade_context: &trade_context "Global plastic waste trade patterns shifted following China's 2018 import ban and the Basel Convention amendments that took effect in 2021, which require prior informed consent for most plastic waste shipments."
  data_caveat: &data_caveat "This data may not capture all plastic waste trade. Some plastic waste is traded under other codes (such as HS 3825 for refuse-derived fuels), and discrepancies can exist between what exporting and importing countries report."
  air_transport_note: &air_transport_note "Air transport typically accounts for a small fraction of total plastic waste trade due to the material's weight and relatively low value per tonne."

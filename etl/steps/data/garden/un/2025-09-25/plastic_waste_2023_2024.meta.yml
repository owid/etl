  hs_classification: &hs_classification "This covers plastic waste classified under HS code 3915 ('waste, parings and scrap, of plastics') in UN Comtrade trade statistics. This includes waste from different polymer types such as polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)."
  all_transport_modes: &all_transport_modes "It includes all transport methods: air, sea, road, rail, inland waterways, and cases where the transport mode wasn't specified."
  per_capita_explanation: &per_capita_explanation "This allows fairer comparisons between countries of different sizes."
  trade_context: &trade_context "Global plastic waste trade patterns changed dramatically after China's 2018 import ban and the Basel Convention amendments that took effect in 2021, which require prior informed consent for most plastic waste shipments."
  data_caveat: &data_caveat "This data may not capture all plastic waste trade. Some plastic waste is traded under other codes (such as HS 3825 for refuse-derived fuels), and there can be discrepancies between what exporting and importing countries report."

        description_key:
          - This only includes plastic waste (HS 3915) transported by air.
          - Air transport typically accounts for a very small fraction of total plastic waste imports—most plastic waste travels by sea or land due to its weight and relatively low value per tonne.

        description_key:
          - This is calculated by dividing total plastic waste imports (HS 3915, all transport modes) by the country's population.
          - *per_capita_explanation
          - A country with 10 million people importing 1,000 tonnes will have the same per capita figure as a country with 100 million people importing 10,000 tonnes.
        description_processing: We calculated this by converting total imports from tonnes to kilograms (multiplying by 1,000) and dividing by the country's population.

        description_short: Net plastic waste trade balance (exports minus imports), measured in tonnes per year.
        description_key:
          - This is calculated as total exports minus total imports of plastic waste (HS 3915).
          - A positive number means the country is a net exporter of plastic waste—it sends more abroad than it receives. A negative number means the country is a net importer of plastic waste—it receives more than it sends.
          - *data_caveat
        description_processing: We calculated this by subtracting total imports from total exports for each country and year.

        description_short: The percentage of global plastic waste imports that a country accounts for.
        description_key:
          - This shows what share of the world's total plastic waste imports each country receives.
          - It's calculated by dividing a country's imports by the sum of all countries' reported imports in that year.
          - For example, if a country imported 100,000 tonnes and the world total was 10 million tonnes, their share would be 1%.
        description_processing: We calculated this by dividing each country's total imports by the global sum of imports for that year, then multiplying by 100 to express as a percentage.

        description_key:
          - This is the net trade balance (exports minus imports) divided by population.
          - A positive number means each person in the country is associated with net exports of that many kilograms. A negative number means each person in the country is associated with net imports of that many kilograms.

          - This shows how much of a country's plastic waste exports travel by air freight versus other transport methods.
          - It's almost always a very small percentage—most plastic waste travels by sea or land because it is heavy and relatively low-value per tonne.
          - Only shown for countries and years where both air transport and total export data are available.

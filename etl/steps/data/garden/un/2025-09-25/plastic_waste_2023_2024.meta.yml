      net_export:
        title: Net exports of plastic waste via all modes of transport
        unit: tonnes
        short_unit: t
        description_short: The difference between plastic waste exports and imports, in tonnes, where positive values indicate net exports and negative values indicate net imports.
        description_key:
          - Calculated as total exports minus total imports of plastic waste.
          - Positive values indicate the country exported more plastic waste than it imported (net exporter).
          - Negative values indicate the country imported more plastic waste than it exported (net importer).
        description_processing: We calculated net exports by subtracting total plastic waste imports from total plastic waste exports for each country and year.

        short_unit: kg
        description_short: The amount of plastic waste imported per person, measured in kilograms.
        description_key:
          - This is calculated by dividing total plastic waste imports (HS 3915, all transport modes) by the country's population.
          - *per_capita_explanation
          - A country with 10 million people importing 1,000 tonnes will have the same per capita figure as a country with 100 million people importing 10,000 tonnes.
        description_processing: Computed as (import_total_mot in tonnes × 1,000) ÷ population; reported in kg per person.

        short_unit: kg
        description_short: The amount of plastic waste exported per person, measured in kilograms.
        description_key:
          - This is calculated by dividing total plastic waste exports (HS 3915, all transport modes) by the country's population.
          - *per_capita_explanation
          - A small country exporting 100 tonnes might have a higher per capita figure than a large country exporting 10,000 tonnes.
        description_processing: Computed as (export_total_mot in tonnes × 1,000) ÷ population; reported in kg per person.

      net_export:
        title: Net exports of plastic waste via all modes of transport
        unit: tonnes
        short_unit: t
        description_short: Net plastic waste trade balance (exports minus imports), measured in tonnes.
        description_key:
          - This is calculated as total exports minus total imports of plastic waste (HS 3915).
          - A positive number means the country is a net exporter of plastic waste.
          - A negative number means the country is a net importer of plastic waste.
          - Differences in how countries report trade, and re-exports, can affect these figures.
        description_processing: Computed as export_total_mot − import_total_mot for each country and year.

      import_share:
        title: Share of global plastic waste imports
        unit: '%'
        short_unit: '%'
        description_short: The percentage of global plastic waste imports that a country accounts for.
        description_key:
          - This shows what share of the world's total plastic waste imports each country receives.
          - It's calculated by dividing a country's imports by the sum of all countries' reported imports in that year.
          - For example, if a country imported 100,000 tonnes and the world total was 10 million tonnes, their share would be 1%.
        description_processing: Computed as 100 × (country import_total_mot) ÷ (sum of import_total_mot across all reporters in the same year).

        description_key:
          - This shows what share of the world's total plastic waste exports each country sends.
          - It's calculated by dividing a country's exports by the sum of all countries' reported exports in that year.
          - For example, if a country exported 500,000 tonnes and the world total was 10 million tonnes, their share would be 5%.
        description_processing: Computed as 100 × (country export_total_mot) ÷ (sum of export_total_mot across all reporters in the same year).

        description_short: Net plastic waste trade balance per person (exports minus imports), measured in kilograms.
        description_key:
          - This is the net trade balance (exports minus imports) divided by population.
          - A positive number means each person in the country is associated with net exports of that many kilograms.
          - A negative number means each person in the country is associated with net imports of that many kilograms.
          - *per_capita_explanation

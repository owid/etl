        **National definitions of urban areas** vary considerably from country to country. Each nation uses its own criteria to define what constitutes an "urban" area, which may include:

        - Population size thresholds
        - Population density requirements
        - Type of economic activity (e.g., agricultural vs. non-agricultural)
        - Physical characteristics of settlements
        - Level of infrastructure and services
        - Administrative or legal city status
        - Or a combination of these factors

        This variability means that a settlement classified as "urban" in one country might be considered "rural" in another, making direct cross-country comparisons challenging.

      - |-
        The UN collects data based on each country's own national definition of urban and rural areas. While this approach respects national statistical practices and reflects how countries themselves understand their urbanization, it creates challenges for international comparability.

      - |-
        For internationally comparable data on urbanization, consider the [Degree of Urbanization (DEGURBA)](#dod:cities-degurba) classification, which applies consistent criteria across all countries using population density and settlement size thresholds.

            Historical estimates (1950-2024) are based on national census data and vital statistics, while projections (2025-2050) use demographic models consistent with the UN World Population Prospects.

            Growth rates are calculated as the average annual rate of change between census years or projection periods, typically 5-year intervals.

          - |-
            Urban growth rates are typically higher than rural rates due to both natural increase and rural-to-urban migration.

            This measures how quickly the urbanization level is changing, not the population growth rate. For example, a value of 0.5 means the urban percentage is increasing by 0.5 percentage points per year on average.

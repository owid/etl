        note: Because the estimates of city and metropolitan areas are based on national definitions of what constitutes a city or metropolitan area, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution.

      **National definitions of urban areas** vary considerably from country to country. Each nation uses its own criteria to define what constitutes an "urban" area, which may include:

      - Population size thresholds
      - Population density requirements
      - Type of economic activity (e.g., agricultural vs. non-agricultural)
      - Physical characteristics of settlements
      - Level of infrastructure and services
      - Administrative or legal city status
      - Or a combination of these factors

    - |-
      This variability means that a settlement classified as "urban" in one country might be considered "rural" in another, making direct cross-country comparisons challenging.

    - |-
      The UN collects data based on each country's own national definition of urban and rural areas. While this approach respects national statistical practices and reflects how countries themselves understand their urbanization, it creates challenges for international comparability.

    - |-
      For internationally comparable data on urbanization, consider our charts using [Degree of Urbanization (DEGURBA)](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/degurbaDefinitions.php) classification, which applies consistent criteria across all countries using population density and settlement size thresholds.

          - Growth rates are calculated as the average annual rate of change between census years or projection periods, typically 5-year intervals.
          - Urban growth rates are typically higher than rural rates due to both natural increase and rural-to-urban migration.

        description_short: The concept of an 'urban area' lacks a universal definition, with national variations based on minimum population thresholds or other metrics like population density, infrastructure, and pre-defined cities.
        description_key:
          - There is no consistent definition of what constitutes an 'urban area'. This is highly variable across countries. This data presents a given country's minimum threshold of inhabitants needed for it to be defined an 'urban area'. For many countries, there is no defined threshold based on inhabitants; other metrics such as population density, infrastructure, or even pre-defined cities may be used.
          - Note that some countries with minimum inhabitant thresholds noted here also include additional qualities (such as population density) to be met.

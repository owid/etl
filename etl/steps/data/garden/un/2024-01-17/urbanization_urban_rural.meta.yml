      The projection method for urban population in the World Urbanization Prospects involves a two-step process using an established extrapolation method based on urban-rural ratios. Initially, the average annual rate of change in the urban-rural ratio is calculated using data from the last two censuses, which informs the rate of change in urban and rural populations. This rate is then extrapolated, assuming a logistic path of urban proportion growth. Subsequently, a "world norm" is applied, estimated from empirical urban-rural growth differences in two groups of countries categorized by population size. This norm uses a regression equation to establish a hypothetical urban-rural growth difference for different levels of initial urban percentage.

      The country-specific urban-rural growth difference is then converged with this hypothetical difference over 25 years, allowing the urbanization process of a country to align with a global urbanization pattern. This method ensures that urban-rural growth differences evolve towards a worldwide trend rather than remaining constant.

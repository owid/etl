          For countries with generalized HIV epidemics and high HIV prevalence, HIV/AIDS is a leading
          cause of death during pregnancy and after delivery. Furthermore, evidence suggests
          that women with HIV infection have an eight times higher risk of pregnancy-related death
          compared with non-HIV infected women. When estimating maternal mortality in these countries,
          it is, thus, important to differentiate between incidental HIV deaths (non-maternal deaths)
          and HIV-related indirect maternal deaths (maternal deaths caused by the aggravating effects of
          pregnancy on HIV) among HIV-positive pregnant and postpartum women who have died.

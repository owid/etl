          GNI per capita (formerly GNP per capita) is the gross national income, converted to U.S. dollars using the World Bank Atlas method, divided by the midyear population. GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad.

          GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions.

        description: |
          The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period. It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth. Maternal deaths: The annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period.

          Live birth: The complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached. (ICD-10) International reporting of maternal mortality For the purpose of international reporting of maternal mortality, only those maternal deaths occurring before the end of the 42-day reference period should be included in the calculation of the various ratios and rates. The recording of later deaths is encouraged to inform national, regional, and global understanding of these events.

          The labour force participation rate is a measure of the proportion of a country's working-age population that engages actively in the labour market, either by working or looking for work; it provides an indication of the size of the supply of labour available to engage in the production of goods and services, relative to the population at working age. The breakdown of the labour force (formerly known as economically active population) by sex and age group gives a profile of the distribution of the labour force within a country.

          Measured by:

            – Life expectancy at birth
            – Mean years of schooling & Expected years of schooling
            – GNI per capita (in PPP adjusted international-$)

          The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions.

          An unweighted average of inequalities in health, education and income is denoted as the coefficient of human inequality. It averages these inequalities using the arithmetic mean:

          (Inequality in health + Inequality in gender + Inequality in income) / 3

          When all inequalities in dimensions are of a similar magnitude, the coefficient of human inequality and the loss in HDI value differ negligibly. When inequalities differ in magnitude, the loss in HDI value tends to be higher than the coefficient of human inequality.

        description: |
          The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) adjusts the Human Development Index (HDI) for inequality in the distribution of each dimension across the population. It is based on a distribution-sensitive class of composite indices proposed by Foster, Lopez-Calva and Szekely (2005), which draws on the Atkinson (1970) family of inequality measures. It is computed as a geometric mean of inequality-adjusted dimensional indices.

          The IHDI accounts for inequalities in HDI dimensions by “discounting” each dimension's average value according to its level of inequality. The IHDI value equals the HDI value when there is no inequality across people but falls below the HDI value as inequality rises. In this sense the IHDI measures the level of human development when inequality is accounted for.

      # 3. Gender Development Index

        title: Gender Development Index
        unit: ""
        description: |
          The Gender Development Index (GDI) measures gender inequalities in achievement in three basic dimensions of human development: health, measured by female and male life expectancy at birth; education, measured by female and male expected years of schooling for children and female and male mean years of schooling for adults ages 25 years and older; and command over economic resources, measured by female and male estimated earned income.

          Values below 1 indicate higher human development for men than women, while values above 1 indicate the opposite. Values close to 1 therefore indicate higher gender equality.

        description: |
          The GDI groups are based on the absolute deviation of GDI from gender parity, 100 ∙ |GDI – 1|.

          - Group 1: Countries with absolute deviation from gender parity of 2.5 percent or less are considered countries with high equality in HDI achievements between women and men.
          - Group 2: Countries with absolute deviation from gender parity of 2.5–5 percent are considered countries with medium-high equality in HDI achievements between women and men.
          - Group 3: Countries with absolute deviation from gender parity of 5–7.5 percent are considered countries with medium equality in HDI achievements between women and men.
          - Group 4: Countries with absolute deviation from gender parity of 7.5–10 percent are considered countries with medium-low equality in HDI achievements between women and men.
          - Group 5: Countries with absolute deviation from gender parity of more than 10 percent are considered countries with low equality in HDI achievements between women and men.

        title: Gender Inequality Index
        unit: ""
        description: |
          The Gender Inequality Index (GII) reflects gender-based disadvantage in three dimensions— reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market—for as many countries as data of reasonable quality allow. It shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimensions. It ranges from 0, where women and men fare equally, to 1, where one gender fares as poorly as possible in all measured dimensions.

          GII values are computed using the association-sensitive inequality measure suggested by Seth (2009), which implies that the index is based on the general mean of general means of different orders—the first aggregation is by a geometric mean across dimensions; these means, calculated separately for women and men, are then aggregated using a harmonic mean across genders.

      # 6. Planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index

        unit: ""
        description: |
          The Planetary pressures–adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI) adjusts the Human Development Index (HDI) for planetary pressures in the Anthropocene. The PHDI discounts the HDI for pressures on the planet to reflect a concern for intergenerational inequality, similar to the Inequality-adjusted HDI adjustment, which is motivated by a concern for intragenerational inequality. The PHDI is computed as the product of the HDI and (1 – index of planetary pressures), where (1 – index of planetary pressures) can be seen as an adjustment factor.

          The PHDI is the level of human development adjusted by carbon dioxide emissions per capita (production) and material footprint per capita to account for the excessive human pressure on the planet. It should be seen as an incentive for transformation. In an ideal scenario, with no pressures on the planet, the PHDI equals the HDI. However, as pressures increase, the PHDI falls below the HDI. In this sense the PHDI measures the level of human development when planetary pressures are considered.

        unit: "tonnes per capita"
        description: |
          Material footprint is the attribution of global material extraction to domestic final demand of a country. Material footprint is calculated as raw material equivalent of imports plus domestic extraction minus raw material equivalents of exports. The total material footprint is the sum of the material footprint for biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and nonmetal ores. Material footprint per capita describes the average material use for final demand.

          Data was soured by UNDP from: UNEP (2022).

    description_processing: The UN's country profiles show different household subtypes across years because their data sources use varying classification systems. For example, in the US, one of the data sources categorizes households that include extended families and non-relatives, whereas another source appears to classify these households as "unknown." As a result, when the total share of household types does not sum to 100%, we assign the remaining share as "unknown."

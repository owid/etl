      Import values are recorded as a (Cost, Insurance and Freight)-type (CIF-type) value. CIF-type values include the transaction value of the goods, the
      value of services performed to deliver goods to the border of the exporting country, and the value of the services
      performed to deliver the goods from the border of the exporting country to the border of the importing country.


      "Other Asia, not elsewhere specified" refers to territories belonging to Asia, but not specified by country. More details at

          The HDI is a summary measure of key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, a good education, and a decent standard of living. Higher values indicate higher human development.
        description_key: &description_key_hdi
          - "Each of the dimensions of the HDI is measured with four indicators: a long and healthy life is measured by _life expectancy at birth_, good education (knowledge) is measured by two indicators, _expected_ and _mean_ _years of schooling_; and a decent standard of living is measured by _Gross National Income (GNI) per capita_, logarithmized to reflect that incomes become less important as they increase."
          - "The index is then calculated by normalizing and aggregating the indicators. First, the indicators are brought onto the same scale, ranging from 0 to 1. This is done by setting minimum and maximum values for each indicator, and a country at or below the minimum value receiving a score of 0, and a country at or above the maximum value receiving a score of 1."
          - "The minimum and maximum values for each indicator are defined as follows: _Life expectancy at birth_ ranges between 20 and 85 years; _expected years of schooling_ between 0 and 18 years; _mean years of schooling_, between 0 and 15 years; and _GNI per capita_ between 100 and 75,000 international-$ at 2017 prices."
          - The HDI is then estimated as the geometric mean of these indices, or _HDI = (Health index * Education index * Income index)^(1/3)_. The education index is the arithmetic mean (average) of the mean years of schooling and expected years of schooling.
        description_from_producer: &description_prod_hdi |-
          The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and having a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions.

          The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of schooling for children of school entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The HDI uses the logarithm of income, to reflect the diminishing importance of income with increasing GNI. The scores for the three HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a composite index using geometric mean. Refer to Technical notes for more details.

          The HDI can be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes. These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.

          The HDI simplifies and captures only part of what human development entails. It does not reflect on inequalities, poverty, human security, empowerment, etc. The HDRO provides other composite indices as broader proxy on some of the key issues of human development, inequality, gender disparity and poverty.

          A fuller picture of a country's level of human development requires analysis of other indicators and information presented in the HDR statistical annex.

          The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) is a summary measure of key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, a good education, and a decent standard of living, adjusted for inequalities in these dimensions. Higher values indicate higher and more equal human development.
        description_key:
          - The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) adjusts the Human Development Index (HDI) for inequality in the distribution of each dimension across the population.
          - It is based on a distribution-sensitive class of composite indices proposed by Foster, Lopez-Calva and Szekely (2005), which draws on the Atkinson (1970) family of inequality measures. It is computed as a geometric mean of inequality-adjusted dimensional indices.
          - The IHDI accounts for inequalities in HDI dimensions by “discounting” each dimension's average value according to its level of inequality. The IHDI value equals the HDI value when there is no inequality across people but falls below the HDI value as inequality rises. In this sense the IHDI measures the level of human development when inequality is accounted for.

          This index covers three dimensions: reproductive health, empowerment, and economic status. Scores are between 0-1 and higher values indicate higher inequalities.
        description_key:
          - The Gender Inequality Index (GII) reflects gender-based disadvantage in three dimensions— reproductive health, empowerment and the labour market—for as many countries as data of reasonable quality allow. It shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimensions. It ranges from 0, where women and men fare equally, to 1, where one gender fares as poorly as possible in all measured dimensions.
          - GII values are computed using the association-sensitive inequality measure suggested by Seth (2009), which implies that the index is based on the general mean of general means of different orders—the first aggregation is by a geometric mean across dimensions; these means, calculated separately for women and men, are then aggregated using a harmonic mean across genders.

          Adjustment of the Human Development Index (HDI) for planetary pressures in the Anthropocene. The PHDI discounts the HDI for pressures on the planet to reflect a concern for intergenerational inequality, similar to the Inequality-adjusted HDI adjustment, which is motivated by a concern for intragenerational inequality.
        description_key:
          - The PHDI is computed as the product of the HDI and (1 - index of planetary pressures), where (1 - index of planetary pressures) can be seen as an adjustment factor.
          - The PHDI is the level of human development adjusted by carbon dioxide emissions per capita (production) and material footprint per capita to account for the excessive human pressure on the planet.
          - The PHDI should be seen as an incentive for transformation. In an ideal scenario, with no pressures on the planet, the PHDI equals the HDI.
          - However, as pressures increase, the PHDI falls below the HDI. In this sense the PHDI measures the level of human development when planetary pressures are considered.

          Measures the total income earned by residents of a country, including income earned abroad. This data is adjusted for inflation and differences in the cost of living between countries.
        description_key: &description_key_gnipc
          - GNI per capita (formerly GNP per capita) is the gross national income, converted to U.S. dollars using the World Bank Atlas method, divided by the midyear population. GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad (World Bank).
          - GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions (World Bank).

        description_key:
          - It depicts the risk of maternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially captures the risk of death in a single pregnancy or a single live birth (WHO).
          - Maternal deaths are defined as "the annual number of female deaths from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, expressed per 100,000 live births, for a specified time period." (WHO).
          - Live births are defined as "the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached." (WHO).
          - (ICD-10) International reporting of maternal mortality For the purpose of international reporting of maternal mortality, only those maternal deaths occurring before the end of the 42-day reference period should be included in the calculation of the various ratios and rates. The recording of later deaths is encouraged to inform national, regional, and global understanding of these events (WHO).

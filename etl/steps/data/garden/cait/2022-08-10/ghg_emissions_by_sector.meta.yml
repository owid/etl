  title: Greenhouse gas emissions by sector (CAIT, 2022)
  short_name: ghg_emissions_by_sector
  description: |
    Emissions are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO₂e), based on 100-year global warming potential factors for non-CO₂ gases.

    Emissions are broken down by sector. Further information on sector definitions is available [here](https://ourworldindata.org/ghg-emissions-by-sector).

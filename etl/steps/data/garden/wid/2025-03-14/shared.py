METHODOLOGY_DESCRIPTION = [
    "The data is estimated from a combination of household surveys, tax records and national accounts data. This combination can provide a more accurate picture of the incomes of the richest, which tend to be captured poorly in household survey data alone.",
    "These underlying data sources are not always available. For some countries, observations are extrapolated from data relating to other years, or are sometimes modeled based on data observed in other countries. For more information on this methodology, see this related [technical note](https://wid.world/document/countries-with-regional-income-imputations-on-wid-world-world-inequality-lab-technical-note-2021-15/).",
]

METHODOLOGY_DESCRIPTION_WEALTH = [
    "The data is constructed using the Mixed Income Capitalization-Survey (MICS) method, which combines capitalized income flows from tax data with survey-based estimates for assets that do not generate taxable income. This is done because wealth distributions are usually not directly available in administrative data, and because wealth surveys coverage is even more limited than for income.",
    "Even with those considerations, the underlying data is not always available. For some countries, observations are extrapolated from data relating to other years, or are sometimes modeled based on data observed in other countries.

POST_TAX_NATIONAL_DESCRIPTION = [
    "In the case of national post-tax income, when the data sources are not available, distributions are constructed by using the more widely available pre-tax distributions, combined with tax revenue and government expenditure aggregates.

RELATIVE_POVERTY_DESCRIPTION = "This data has been estimated by calculating the {povline}, and then checking that value against the closest threshold in the percentile distribution. The headcount ratio is then the percentile, the share of the population below that threshold."

PROCESSING_DESCRIPTION = """We extract estimations of Gini, mean, percentile thresholds, averages, and shares via the [`wid` Stata command](https://github.com/thomasblanchet/wid-stata-tool). We calculate threshold and share ratios by dividing different thresholds and shares, respectively."""

      - The majority of the data is sourced from USGS, supplemented by BGS data where available. Where both overlap, USGS data is prioritized.
      - As BGS does not provide global data, we calculated the world total by summing the data from individual countries, using this as a cross-check against USGS global figures.
      - Due to the inherent uncertainties in the data for certain minerals and countries, we allowed a maximum deviation of 10% between the global totals reported by USGS and the calculated ones for BGS. If the deviation exceeded this threshold, we excluded the BGS data.
      - The calculated global total from BGS data was used only on exceptional occasions, after ensuring that the resulting aggregate was sufficiently complete.
      - Both BGS and USGS datasets include numerous notes and footnotes. We have retained most of these, making only minor edits or deletions where necessary to maintain clarity.

    - "Unit value represents the price of a physical unit of apparent consumption (such as a metric ton) in dollars. Apparent consumption itself is determined by the formula: Apparent Consumption = Production + Imports - Exports Â± (Stock Change)."
    - For commodities that exist in a single physical form, like copper, a straightforward price series can estimate the unit value.
    - However, for commodities like chromium, which encompass multiple forms (e.g., metal, ferroalloys, ore), weighted averages are used, with each form's price weighted by its contribution to total consumption.
    - When no direct price series is available, unit values are derived using export, import, and production data.
    - To ensure consistency over time, these values are reported in 1998 constant dollars, adjusted for inflation.

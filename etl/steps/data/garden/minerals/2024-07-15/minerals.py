"""Compilation of minerals data from different origins.

Currently, the three sources of minerals data are:
* From BGS we extract production and disregard imports/exports, which are very sparse.
* From USGS (current) we extract production and reserves.
* From USGS (historical) we extract production and unit value.

For debugging:
* Add columns to PLOT_TO_COMPARE_DATA_SOURCES (defined below) to plot the data for that column separated by data source.
* Comment/uncomment columns in COMBINE_BGS_AND_USGS_COLUMNS (defined below). Two sanity checks will be performed on these columns.
  * First, we will check if the aggregated global data from only BGS (which was calculated in the garden BGS step) is significantly larger than USGS' World data.
  * Second, we will create an aggregated global data after combining BGS and USGS data, and then check if this is larger than USGS' original World data.
  In the two checks above, "significantly larger" means that the aggregated World data is larger than the original USGS's World by more than DEVIATION_MAX_ACCEPTED. If so, an error is raised, and a plot is displayed comparing the two "World" series.
  We have two ways to tackle these issues:
  * Accept the discrepancy between BGS and USGS data. We do this if BGS data is significantly larger on years where we have USGS data, since the latter will replace the former when combining both.
  * Remove data (for all countries except USGS' World) on specific years where BGS data is significantly larger. Ideally, we would not need to do this, and instead we would fetch the rest of USGS' data. However, USGS' data is in a very inconvenient format, and it is a big investment of time to fetch all of it. So, exceptionally, we remove points where BGS data is clearly overestimated, compared to USGS.
  NOTE: We allow this where one or a few BGS data points are significantly larger than USGS (e.g. Lead). But we do not do this if many points in BGS data are consistently larger than USGS (e.g. Graphite).

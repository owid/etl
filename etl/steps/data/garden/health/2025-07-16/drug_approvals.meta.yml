        unit: 'approvals'
        short_unit: ''
        description_short: |-
          The annual number of new drugs approved by the FDA. This is broken down into [new chemical drugs](#dod:new-molecular-entity), new vaccines, and other new biologics such as antibodies and gene therapies. The data does not include [generics](#dod:generic-drug), reformulations, or [biosimilars](#dod:biosimilar).

          - This data includes both [new molecular entities](#dod:new-molecular-entity) (NMEs) and [biologics license applications](#dod:biologics-license-application) (BLAs) approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) of the FDA.
          - Biologicals approved by the CBER have been extracted from the FDA's "Purple Book", which lists licensed biological products with reference product exclusivity and biosimilarity or interchangeability evaluations.
          - We removed [biosimilars](#dod:biosimilar) from the dataset, since we are only focusing on new drugs, by excluding products with a "biosimilar" or "interchangeable" license type as well as products with a reference product listed.

              This data includes [biologics license applications (BLAs)](#dod:biologics-license-application)” (used for biologics and vaccines) and “[new molecular entities (NMEs)](#dod:new-molecular-entity)” (used for chemical drugs). Data on approvals of chemical drugs are only available from 1984.

          The annual number of new drugs approved by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), that fall under each designation, including [Orphan Drugs](#dod:orphan-drug), [Fast Track](#dod:fda-fast-track), [Accelerated Approval](#dod:fda-accelerated-approval), [Breakthrough Therapy](#dod:breakthrough-therapy), and [Qualified Infectious Disease Product](#dod:qualified-infectious-disease-product).

              Designations can be overlapping; a drug can receive multiple designations. CDER is part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

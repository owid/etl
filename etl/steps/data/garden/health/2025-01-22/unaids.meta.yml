    Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven effective in lowering HIV-related illness and death rates among people living with HIV, as well as preventing the virus's transmission. Research indicates that starting treatment early, irrespective of an individual's CD4 cell count, maximizes benefits and saves lives. The World Health Organization (WHO) now advises ART for everyone diagnosed with HIV.

          The number of people dying from AIDS-related causes can be obtained using a variety of measures, including through a vital registration system adjusted for misreporting, as part of a facility- or population-based survey that may include verbal autopsy and through mathematical modelling using such tools as Spectrum. Modelling tools typically use demographic data, HIV prevalence from survey and surveillance, the number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy, HIV incidence and assumptions around survival patterns to estimate the number of people dying. In some instances, data from vital reporting systems and estimates of underreporting and misclassification also may be incorporated into these models to derive estimates of the number of AIDS-related deaths.

          The source of the estimate is requested. Countries providing the number of people dying from AIDS-related causes derived from a source other than Spectrum should provide any accompanying estimates of uncertainty around this number and upload an electronic copy of the report describing how the number was calculated.

          Countries should preferably report a modelled estimate rather than one derived from their vital registration system unless this system has been recently evaluated as one of high quality. Users can now opt to use their Spectrum estimate or enter nationally representative population-level data. If Spectrum estimates are chosen, the values will be pulled directly from the software once the national file is finalized.

        description_from_producer: |-
          The mother-to-child transmission probability differs with the antiretroviral drug regimen received and infant-feeding practices. The transmission can be calculated by using the Spectrum model.

          The Spectrum computer programme uses the information on:

          a. the distribution of HIV-positive pregnant women receiving different antiretroviral regimens prior to and during delivery (peripartum) by CD4 category of the mother
          b. the distribution of women and children receiving antiretrovirals after delivery (postpartum) by CD4 category of the mother.
          c. the percent of infants who are not breastfeeding in PMTCT programmes by age of the child
          d. mother-to-child transmission of HIV probabilities based on various categories of antiretroviral drug regimen and infant feeding practices

          The estimated national transmission rate is reported in the PMTCT summary display in Spectrum. This variable can also be calculated using the variables in Spectrum on “New HIV infections” for children 0-14 years and dividing this by the variable “Women in need of PMTCT”

          There is not enough information available about other HIV transmission routes for children to include such infections in the model. In addition other modes of transmission are believed to be a small fraction of the overall infections among children. The Spectrum output variable “New HIV infections for children 0-1 years” is not used because some infections due to breastfeeding will take place after age 1 year

          - The main goal of the global AIDS response is to reduce new HIV infections to below 200,000 by 2030. Monitoring the rate of new infections over time is essential to assess progress towards this target.
          - This indicator is a crucial metric in the WHO 2022 Consolidated guidelines on person-centered HIV strategic information.
        description_processing: |-
          Methods for monitoring incidence can vary depending on the epidemic setting and are typically categorized either as direct or indirect measures. Direct measurement at a population level is preferred but can often be difficult to obtain. As a result, most if not all countries rely on indirect measures or triangulate direct and indirect methods.

          Strategies for directly measuring HIV incidence include longitudinal follow-up and repeat testing among individuals who do not have HIV infection and estimation using a laboratory test for recent HIV infection and clinical data in the population. Longitudinal monitoring is often costly and difficult to perform at a population level. Laboratory testing of individuals to determine the recency of infection also raises cost and complexity challenges since a nationally representative population-based survey is typically required to obtain estimates.

          Indirect methods most frequently rely on estimates constructed from mathematical modelling tools, such as Spectrum or the AIDS Epidemic Model. These models may incorporate geographical and population-specific HIV surveys, surveillance, case reporting, mortality, programme and clinical data and, in some instances, assumptions about risk behavior and HIV transmission. In some instances, countries may wish to triangulate these data with other sources of estimates of the number of people newly infected, including from serial population-based HIV prevalence estimates or estimates of HIV prevalence in young, recently exposed populations.

          Note that case-based surveillance systems capturing newly reported people acquiring HIV infection should not be used as a direct source of estimating the number of people newly infected with HIV in the reporting year. Because of reporting delays and under-diagnosis, newly reported cases may not reflect the actual rate of people becoming newly infected. This information may be useful, however, for triangulation or validation purposes, especially when combined with tests for the recency of HIV infection.

          Disaggregated data reported for the numerator should be used to monitor progress towards eliminating new child infections and reducing the number of new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women to below 100,000 per year.

        description_key:
          - An Incidence-to-Mortality Ratio (IMR) below 1.0 indicates that the number of new HIV infections is less than the number of deaths among people living with HIV, suggesting a declining epidemic.
          - The IMR is used to assess the progress towards controlling the HIV epidemic and is considered alongside other metrics such as the incidence-prevalence ratio.

          People living with HIV who know their HIV status will be able to access the HIV care and treatment services required to live healthy, productive lives and to reduce the potential of transmitting HIV to other people. The most effective way to ensure that people living with HIV are aware of their HIV status is to offer HIV testing services at locations and among populations with the highest HIV burden.

        description_key:
          - "This measure is the first 95 of the UNAIDS 95-95-95 target: that 95% of the people living with HIV know their HIV status by 2025."
          - This indicator is pivotal in the HIV response strategy. Knowing one's HIV status is more than just a medical statistic—it's a transformative moment that opens doors to comprehensive care and personal health management.
          - "The gap between total HIV infections and diagnosed cases represents a significant challenge in global health. Many individuals may be unaware of their status due to various barriers, including: Limited access to testing facilities, stigma and discrimination, lack of awareness, financial constraints, cultural or personal hesitation about testing, etc."

        description_from_producer: |-
          Individual-level viral load is the recommended measure of antiretroviral therapy efficacy and indicates treatment adherence and the risk of transmitting HIV. A viral load threshold of <1000 copies/mL defines treatment success according to the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) Consolidated guidelines on the use of antiretroviral drugs for treating and preventing HIV infection. People with viral load test results below the threshold should be considered as having suppressed viral loads.

        description_key:
          - Viral load suppression is a key medical achievement that transforms HIV from a life-threatening condition to a manageable chronic illness. It shows that the virus is under control and the risk of transmission is low.
          - According to WHO guidelines, a viral load below 1,000 copies/mL is considered suppressed, indicating effective treatment and adherence.

          - Viral suppression represents the third and final 90 of the global target, aiming to ensure that patients on ART achieve and maintain viral suppression. This minimizes their risk of disease progression and HIV transmission. Achieving viral suppression is crucial for service quality, as an unsuppressed viral load may indicate suboptimal treatment adherence and the potential for developing and spreading drug resistance.

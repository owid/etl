    Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven effective in lowering HIV-related illness and death rates among people living with HIV, as well as preventing the virus's transmission. Research indicates that starting treatment early, irrespective of an individual's CD4 cell count, maximizes benefits and saves lives. The World Health Organization (WHO) now advises ART for everyone diagnosed with HIV.

          The number of people dying from AIDS-related causes can be obtained using a variety of measures, including through a vital registration system adjusted for misreporting, as part of a facility- or population-based survey that may include verbal autopsy and through mathematical modelling using such tools as Spectrum. Modelling tools typically use demographic data, HIV prevalence from survey and surveillance, the number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy, HIV incidence and assumptions around survival patterns to estimate the number of people dying. In some instances, data from vital reporting systems and estimates of underreporting and misclassification also may be incorporated into these models to derive estimates of the number of AIDS-related deaths.

          The source of the estimate is requested. Countries providing the number of people dying from AIDS-related causes derived from a source other than Spectrum should provide any accompanying estimates of uncertainty around this number and upload an electronic copy of the report describing how the number was calculated.

          Countries should preferably report a modelled estimate rather than one derived from their vital registration system unless this system has been recently evaluated as one of high quality. Users can now opt to use their Spectrum estimate or enter nationally representative population-level data. If Spectrum estimates are chosen, the values will be pulled directly from the software once the national file is finalized.

          The mother-to-child transmission probability differs with the antiretroviral drug regimen received and infant-feeding practices. The transmission can be calculated by using the Spectrum model.

          The Spectrum computer programme uses the information on:

          a. the distribution of HIV-positive pregnant women receiving different antiretroviral regimens prior to and during delivery (peripartum) by CD4 category of the mother
          b. the distribution of women and children receiving antiretrovirals after delivery (postpartum) by CD4 category of the mother.
          c. the percent of infants who are not breastfeeding in PMTCT programmes by age of the child
          d. mother-to-child transmission of HIV probabilities based on various categories of antiretroviral drug regimen and infant feeding practices

          The estimated national transmission rate is reported in the PMTCT summary display in Spectrum. This variable can also be calculated using the variables in Spectrum on “New HIV infections” for children 0-14 years and dividing this by the variable “Women in need of PMTCT”

          There is not enough information available about other HIV transmission routes for children to include such infections in the model. In addition other modes of transmission are believed to be a small fraction of the overall infections among children. The Spectrum output variable “New HIV infections for children 0-1 years” is not used because some infections due to breastfeeding will take place after age 1 year

        description_processing: |-
          Methods for monitoring incidence can vary depending on the epidemic setting and are typically categorized either as direct or indirect measures. Direct measurement at a population level is preferred but can often be difficult to obtain. As a result, most if not all countries rely on indirect measures or triangulate direct and indirect methods.

          Strategies for directly measuring HIV incidence include longitudinal follow-up and repeat testing among individuals who do not have HIV infection and estimation using a laboratory test for recent HIV infection and clinical data in the population. Longitudinal monitoring is often costly and difficult to perform at a population level. Laboratory testing of individuals to determine the recency of infection also raises cost and complexity challenges since a nationally representative population-based survey is typically required to obtain estimates.

          Indirect methods most frequently rely on estimates constructed from mathematical modelling tools, such as Spectrum or the AIDS Epidemic Model. These models may incorporate geographical and population-specific HIV surveys, surveillance, case reporting, mortality, programme and clinical data and, in some instances, assumptions about risk behavior and HIV transmission. In some instances, countries may wish to triangulate these data with other sources of estimates of the number of people newly infected, including from serial population-based HIV prevalence estimates or estimates of HIV prevalence in young, recently exposed populations.

          Note that case-based surveillance systems capturing newly reported people acquiring HIV infection should not be used as a direct source of estimating the number of people newly infected with HIV in the reporting year. Because of reporting delays and under-diagnosis, newly reported cases may not reflect the actual rate of people becoming newly infected. This information may be useful, however, for triangulation or validation purposes, especially when combined with tests for the recency of HIV infection.

          Disaggregated data reported for the numerator should be used to monitor progress towards eliminating new child infections and reducing the number of new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women to below 100,000 per year.

        description_from_producer: |-
          This indicator is key to assessing the availability and uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), especially among people at substantial risk of HIV infection. Through data disaggregation, this indicator will also attempt to monitor the availability and use by population (based on age, gender and key population). The use of antiretroviral medicines by people who are HIV-negative before they are exposed to HIV can prevent HIV infection. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that oral PrEP containing tenofovir (TDF) be offered as an additional prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of combination HIV prevention approaches. In 2021, WHO recommended the dapivirine vaginal ring (DVR) as an additional PrEP option to be offered to cisgender women at substantial risk of HIV. In 2022, WHO recommended that long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA) may be offered as an additional PrEP option to people at substantial risk of HIV.

          In 2024, WHO updated the guidance on oral PrEP dosing regimens, which are determined by a combination of factors based on a person’scharacteristics, circumstances and route of exposure. The guidance no longer uses the term “event-driven PrEP” (ED-PrEP), given the variation possible within oral PrEP dosing.

          Implementation of PrEP should be informed by several contextual factors. These include national and subnational epidemiological trends; programmatic feasibility and demand; and consideration of the social environment for people living with HIV and people from key populations and their access to services. PrEP implementation criteria may vary by country.

          This indicator measures the performance of the TB program in ensuring that TB cases know their HIV status.

          Numerator: Number of new and relapsed TB cases with documented HIV status, during the reporting period

          Denominator: Total number of new and relapsed TB cases, during the reporting period

          The numerator and denominator can be obtained from basic management unit TB registers as well as additional data collection sources (i.e., HIV testing registers) that may contain relevant information (i.e., HIV test results, enrollment in HIV care programs). Programs should modify the register as needed to easily capture this information (<1 F, <1 M, 1-4 F, 1-4 M, 5-9 F, 5-9 M, 10-14 F, 10-14 M, 15-19 F, 15-19 M, 20-24 F, 20-24 M, 25-29 F, 25-29 M, 30-34 F, 30-34 M, 35-39 F, 35-39 M, 40-44 F, 40-44 M, 45-49 F, 45-49 M, 50+ F, 50+ M, Unknown age F, Unknown age M) and (Known HIV-positive at service entry).

          The data source is the TB register. There is a risk of double counting as TB patients could be tested multiple times during their TB treatment, therefore partners should ensure a data collection and reporting system is in place to minimize double counting. There is also a risk of undercounting if those patients who already knew their HIV status prior to attending TB clinic are not documented, therefore the TB register at a minimum should document “Known HIV-positive at service entry; Newly tested HIV-positive; Tested HIV negative.”

          This indicator measures the percentage of respondents that answered "YES" to all the responses below:

          1. Can the risk of HIV transmission be reduced by having sex with only one uninfected partner who has no other partners?
          2. Can a person reduce the risk of getting HIV by using a condom every time they have sex?
          3. Can a healthy-looking person have HIV?
          4. Can a person get HIV from mosquito bites?
          5. Can a person get HIV by sharing food with someone who is infected?

          The first three questions should not be altered. Questions 4 and 5 ask about local misconceptions and may be replaced by the most common misconceptions in your country. Examples include: “Can a person get HIV by hugging or shaking hands with a person who is infected?” and “Can a person get HIV through supernatural means?”

          Those who have never heard of HIV and AIDS should be excluded from the numerator but included in the denominator. An answer of “don’t know” should be recorded as an incorrect answer.

          Scores for each of the individual questions (based on the same denominator) are required as well as the score for the composite indicator.

          Discrimination is a human rights violation and is prohibited by international human rights law and most national constitutions. In the context of HIV, discrimination refers to unfair or unjust treatment of an individual (either through actions or by failure to act) based on his or her real or perceived HIV status. Discrimination exacerbates risks and deprives people of their rights and entitlements, thus fueling the HIV epidemic.

          Stigma is the attribution of undesirable characteristics to an individual or group that reduces their status in the eyes of society. It frequently drives experiences of discrimination. The indicator measures HIV-related discrimination experienced in health-care settings. HIV is often associated with a range of behaviours that are viewed as socially deviant or immoral, such as injecting drug use and sexual promiscuity. Because of these underlying societal beliefs, people living with HIV often are viewed as shameful and are thought to be responsible for having contracted HIV. This shaming process has repercussions beyond the individual because it greatly reduces incentives to be tested for HIV or, in the event the test result is positive, to disclose HIV status to sexual partners or family members.

          The health sector is one of the main settings where people living with HIV—and those perceived to be living with HIV—experience discrimination. This indicator directly measures discrimination experienced by people living with HIV when seeking services in health-care settings.

          The composite indicator can be monitored as a measure of the prevalence of HIV-related discrimination experienced in the health sector by people living with HIV. This indicator could provide further understanding of HIV-related health outcomes and improve interventions to reduce and mitigate HIV-related stigma and discrimination experienced along the treatment and care cascade by (a) showing change over time in the percentage of people living with HIV who experience discrimination in health-care settings and (b) indicating priority areas for action.

          The indicator to be reported is total and subtotal HIV expenditures by services or programme categories and by financing sources. There are eight core sub-indicators that map to this reporting. These are outlined under Annex 3.

          By the end of 2020, the international and domestic resource availability for the HIV response reached an estimated US$ 21.5 billion (in constant 2019 dollars) in low- and middle-income countries. Achieving country and global targets requires increased focus, resources, programme effectiveness and efficiency to provide the HIV care, treatment and prevention to reduce HIV incidence and extend life.

          It is critical to identify long-term, sustainable financing sources, including domestic resource mobilization, to maintain and build upon the success achieved. However, filling the financing gap and pursuing efficient resource allocation can only be achieved by assessing and managing the resources available and their use.

          The quantification of financing flows and expenditures helps to examine the questions of who benefits from HIV programmes and to determine the current state of allocations for HIV programmes and services that focus on key or other specific populations.

          The vast majority of the AIDS Spending Categories (or ASCs, per National AIDS Spending Assessment [NASA] classifications) or the sub-indicators are drawn from existing frameworks and are now structured around the 2021 Political Declaration on Ending AIDS. The resource needs for low- and middle-income countries resulted in a target to mobilize at least US$ 29 billion (in constant 2019 US dollars) by 2025.

        description_from_producer: |-
          TB is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV, including those receiving antiretroviral therapy. Prompt TB treatment and early antiretroviral therapy are critical for reducing the mortality due to HIV-associated TB and must be the highest-priority activity for both the AIDS Programme and National TB Programme. A measure of the percentage of HIV-positive TB patients that access appropriate treatment for their TB and HIV is therefore very important.

          Calculated as `Numerator/denominator`, where:

          Numerator: Number of people living with HIV with new or relapse TB started on TB treatment during the reporting period who were already on antiretroviral therapy or started on antiretroviral therapy during TB treatment within the reporting year

          Denominator: Estimated number of people living with HIV with incident TB cases

          For the numerator: Facility antiretroviral therapy registers and reports; programme monitoring tools. Count the total number of HIV-positive new and relapse TB patients who were started on TB treatment (as recorded in the TB register) and antiretroviral therapy, or those already on antiretroviral therapy (as recorded in the antiretroviral therapy register). The information should be reconciled quarterly and annually with the TB registers in the relevant basic management units before consolidation and reporting.

          For the denominator: Programme data and estimates of the number of people living with HIV with incident TB. WHO calculates annual estimates of the number of people living with HIV with incident TB. The denominator become available only in August of the reporting year and do not need to be provided at the time of reporting. The estimates for 2023 are available at https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/data

          Appreciation of hepatitis and HIV coinfection has improved recently. Many people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy are dying from liver disease resulting from untreated viral hepatitis. HIV treatment regimens can be adjusted to treat chronic hepatitis B infection as well. New, highly effective hepatitis C treatment is available and has a high rate of virus clearance regardless of hepatitis C virus subtype. Measuring the hepatitis burden among key populations living with HIV can help national planners determine the resources needed to address the syndemic.

          Calculation: Numerator / Denominator, where:

          Numerator: Number of people in a key population who test positive for both HIV and hepatitis <<"C virus" if hepatitis == "C" else "B surface antigen">>

          Denominator: Number of respondents tested for both HIV and one or both hepatitis B and C

          Strengths and weaknesses:
          Probability-based estimates of coinfection with HIV and hepatitis C virus or HIV and hepatitis B virus among key populations are generally unavailable, although several biobehavioural surveys have conducted hepatitis antibody testing. Improving knowledge about coinfection will help to improve treatment programmes and help to maximize the survival of the affected populations. The numbers of people coinfected are likely to be small, with the possible exception of people who inject drugs, so the confidence intervals will be large.

          A programme may or may not change the rate of male circumcision. For example, changing societal norms not caused by a programme may lead to changing rates of male circumcision. This indicator measures the total change in the population, regardless of the reasons.

          Existing population-based surveys (such as Demographic and Health Surveys) may not accurately measure true male circumcision status because people may lack knowledge of what male circumcision is, be confused about their circumcision status or perceive the social desirability of circumcision status. Other approaches to determining circumcision status might be used: for example, using photographs or drawings (drawings may be more culturally appropriate), prompts or even direct examination. Modelling how changing rates of male circumcision can potential affect HIV incidence requires accurate knowledge of male circumcision status over time.

          Globally, high rates of HIV infection among key populations - including sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs and transgender people - have brought into sharp focus the problem of gender-based violence. There is growing recognition that deep-rooted, pervasive gender inequalities, reflected in gender-based violence, shape their risk of and vulnerability to HIV infection.

          Violence and HIV have been linked through direct and indirect pathways, and studies in a range of countries indicate that many sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs and transgender people have experienced violence in some form or another at some point in their lives. Violence has also been demonstrated to impede HIV prevention, care and treatment services among key populations.

          Calculation: Numerator / Denominator

          Numerator: Number of people in a key population group (sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs or transgender people) who reported that either of the incidents happened to them at least once in the last 12 months.

          Denominator: Total number of respondents from a key population group.

          Method of measurement:
          Behavioural surveillance or other special surveys. Indicators A-D are constructed from responses to the following questions among respondents who report belonging to a key population group (i.e., sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs and transgender people).

          (1) In the last 12 months, how many times has anyone physically hurt you, such as hit or choked you or threatened you with a knife or other weapon (this has not happened in the last 12 months, once, 2-5 times, 6-10 times, 10 or more times, don't know, refuse to answer)?

          and/or

          (2) In the last 12 months, how many times has someone tricked you, lied to you or threatened you in order to make you have sex when you didn't want to (this has not happened in the last 12 months, once, 2-5 times, 6-10 times, 10 or more times, don't know, refuse to answer)?

          The prevalence of syphilis is typically much higher in key populations than in the general population. Reducing the prevalence of syphilis among key populations is important for the health of the population and also a critical measure of the national-level response to syphilis.

          The increasing use of rapid tests for testing (screening) individuals for syphilis has increased access to syphilis testing in settings that were previously without capacity. As a result, this indicator has been expanded to syphilis prevalence rather than focusing solely on active syphilis.

          Testing for syphilis in key populations is a component of second-generation HIV surveillance.

          Calculated as: Numerator / Denominator, where

          Numerator: Number of people in a key population who test positive for syphilis

          Denominator: Number of people in a key population tested for syphilis

          Method of measurement:
          This indicator is calculated using data from syphilis tests conducted among respondents in sentinel site(s) or participants in biobehavioural surveys or regular sexually transmitted infection screening services. The sentinel surveillance sites used for calculating this indicator should remain constant to allow for tracking changes over time.

          Screening may be done with either a nontreponemal test (e.g., venereal disease research laboratory [VDRL] or rapid plasma reagin [RPR]) or a treponemal test (e.g., Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay [TPHA], Treponema pallidum particle agglutination assay [TPPA], enzyme immunoassay or rapid treponemal test). While nontreponemal serologic tests are sensitive, they lack specificity and can result in false positive cases. Treponemal tests are more specific but cannot differentiate between current and past infection or treated and untreated infection. For the purpose of this indicator (intended to measure seropositivity), reporting positivity based on a single test result is acceptable. However, if both treponemal and nontreponemal test results for an individual person are available, then syphilis positivity should be defined as having positive results on both tests. Countries are required to report the testing algorithm used to determine positivity so prevalence estimates can be adjusted to look at trends over time and generate regional and global estimates.

          Gender inequality continues to stand in the way of global goals to end AIDS by 2030. Inequitable gender norms that confine women and men to specific roles in society - together with gender disparities in education and employment - greatly limit HIV prevention strategies among women, girls, and gender and sexual minorities. Fear, experiences of violence and power imbalances in relationships also increase vulnerability to HIV among these groups, limiting their access to HIV services and reducing their adherence to HIV prevention or treatment technologies. This leaves them disproportionately affected by HIV. Scaling up programmes to increase gender equity and intensifying efforts to achieve gender equality is therefore critical for ending AIDS as a global public health threat by 2030.

          Antiretroviral therapy has been shown to reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV and to reduce the transmission of HIV. People living with HIV in key populations should be able to access mainstream services that provide antiretroviral therapy without fear of facing stigma or discrimination and to be able to receive care from health-care workers who have the clinical knowledge to meet their specific needs. Ideally, all of these mainstream services should meet the standards for becoming sensitized to the needs of key populations. Accordingly, antiretroviral therapy coverage is a crucial way of assessing access to mainstream services.

          Discrimination is a human rights violation and is prohibited by international human rights law and most national constitutions. In the context of HIV, discrimination refers to unfair or unjust treatment of an individual (either through actions or by failure to act) based on his or her real or perceived HIV status. Discrimination exacerbates risks and deprives people of their rights and entitlements, thus fueling the HIV epidemic. HIV-related stigma refers to negative beliefs, feelings and attitudes towards people living with HIV, groups associated with people living with HIV (e.g., the families of people living with HIV) and other key populations at higher risk of HIV infection, such as people who inject drugs, sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men and transgender people. In addition to HIV-related stigma, people from key populations experience further discrimination because of the stigma relating to same-sex attraction and sexual behaviour, engagement in sex work, drug use and non-conforming or diverse gender expression.

          This indicator is important for providing a measure of the proportion of members of key populations who have avoided accessing general healthcare services, due to fear of stigma and discrimination. Related reasons for avoiding such services may include (but are not limited to) the following: a lack (or perceived lack of) confidentiality within health-care settings; negative attitudes and behaviours among health-care providers; and fears of disclosing or hinting at individual behaviours and sexual preference/orientation.

          Data related to the avoidance of health-care services are important in measuring the proportion of key populations who are not fulfilling their basic health-care needs (such as routine medical check-ups) and thus may be less likely to attend health-care settings for more specialized services and care (such as HIV testing, treatment and medical care). This indicator is important for understanding and addressing the barriers to achieving the 95-95-95 targets among members of key populations. Data from this indicator directly measure fear of stigma or discrimination.

          This indicator could provide further understanding and improve interventions in reducing HIV stigma and discrimination by (1) showing change over time in the percentage of people who fear experiencing stigma, (2) enabling comparisons between national, provincial, state and more local administrations, and (3) indicating priority areas for action

          Condoms can substantially reduce the risk of sexually transmitting HIV. Consistently and correctly using condoms is therefore important for men who have sex with men because of the high risk of HIV transmission during unprotected anal sex. In addition, men who have anal sex with other men may also have female partners, who could become infected as well. Condom use with the most recent male partner is considered a reliable indicator of longer-term behaviour.

          Note: countries with generalized epidemics may also have a concentrated subepidemic among gay men and other men who have sex with men. If so, calculating and reporting on this indicator for this population would be valuable.

          Method of measurement: Behavioural surveillance or other special surveys

          In a behavioural survey of a sample of gay men and other men who have sex with men, respondents are asked about sexual partnerships in the past six months, about anal sex within these partnerships and about condom use when they last had anal sex. Condom use applies whether the respondent is the receptive and insertive partner.

          Whenever possible, data for gay men and other men who have sex with men should be collected with civil society organizations that have worked closely with this population in the field.

          Access to gay men and other men who have sex with men and the data collected from them must remain confidential and secure.

          Condoms can substantially reduce the risk of sexually transmitting HIV. Consistently and correctly using condoms is therefore important for transgender people, particularly trans-women, because of the high risk of HIV transmission during unprotected anal sex. Condom use with the most recent penetrative sex partner is considered a reliable indicator of longer-term behaviour.

          Method of measurement: Behavioural surveillance or other special surveys

          Respondents are asked the following question: "Did you use a condom during your most recent sexual intercourse or anal sex?"

          Whenever possible, data for transgender people should be collected with civil society organizations that have worked closely with this population in the field. Access to transgender people and the data collected from them must remain confidential and secure.

          <%- elif group == "people who inject drugs" %>
          Safer injecting and sexual practices among people who inject drugs are essential, even in countries in which other modes of HIV transmission predominate, because the risk of HIV transmission from contaminated injecting equipment is extremely high, and people who inject drugs can spread HIV (such as through sexual transmission) to the wider population.

          Note: countries with generalized epidemics may also have a concentrated subepidemic among people who inject drugs. If so, calculating and reporting on this indicator for this population would be valuable.

          Method of measurement: Behavioural surveillance or other special surveys

          People who inject drugs are asked the following sequence of questions:

          1. "Have you injected drugs at any time in the past month?"
          2. "If yes, have you had sexual intercourse in the past month?"

          If they answer yes to both 1 and 2:
          3. "Did you use a condom when you last had sexual intercourse?"

          Whenever possible, data for people who inject drugs should be collected with civil society organizations that have worked closely with this population in the field.

          Access to survey respondents and the data collected from them must remain confidential and secure.

          <%- elif group == "sex workers" %>
          Various factors increase the risk of exposure to HIV among sex workers, including multiple, non-regular partners and more frequent sexual intercourse. However, sex workers can substantially reduce the risk of HIV transmission, both from clients and to clients, by consistently and correctly using condoms.

          Note: countries with generalized epidemics may also have a concentrated subepidemic among sex workers. If so, calculating and reporting on this indicator for this population would be valuable.

          Method of measurement: Behavioural surveillance or other special surveys

          Respondents are asked the following question: "Did you use a condom with your most recent client with whom you had sexual intercourse?"

          Whenever possible, data for sex workers should be collected through or with civil society organizations that have worked closely with this population in the field. Access to sex workers and the data collected from them must remain confidential and secure.

          Condom use is an important way of protecting against HIV, especially among people with non-regular sexual partners.

          Method of measurement: Population-based surveys (Demographic Health Survey, AIDS Indicator Survey, Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey or other representative survey)

          Respondents' sexual histories are obtained. Analysis of sexual history is used to determine whether the respondent had sex with a non-marital, non-cohabiting partner in the past 12 months and, if so, whether the respondent used a condom the last time the respondent had sexual intercourse with such a partner.

          Discrimination is a human rights violation prohibited by international human rights law and most national constitutions. Discrimination in the context of HIV refers to unfair or unjust treatment (an act or an omission) of an individual based on his or her real or perceived HIV status. Discrimination exacerbates risks and deprives people of their rights and entitlements, fuelling the HIV epidemic. This indicator does not directly measure discrimination but rather measures discriminatory attitudes that may result in discriminatory acts (or omissions). One item in the indicator measures the potential support by respondents for discrimination that takes place at an institution and the other measures social distancing or behavioural expressions of prejudice. The composite indicator can be monitored as a measure of a key manifestation of HIV-related stigma and the potential for HIV-related discrimination within the general population. This indicator could provide further understanding and improve interventions in HIV discrimination by: showing change over time in the percentage of people with discriminatory attitudes; allowing comparisons between national, provincial, state and more local administrations; and indicating priority areas for action.

          Method of measurement: Population-based surveys (Demographic and Health Survey, AIDS Indicator Survey, Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey or other representative survey). This indicator is constructed from responses to the following questions in a general population survey from respondents who have heard of HIV.

          - Would you buy fresh vegetables from a shopkeeper or vendor if you knew that this person had HIV? (yes, no, don't know/not sure/it depends)

          - Do you think that children living with HIV should be able to attend school with children who are HIV negative? (yes, no, don't know/not sure/it depends)

          The respondents who have never heard of HIV and AIDS should be excluded from the estimation. Participants who respond don't know/not sure/it depends and those who refuse to answer should also be excluded.

          Yes and no responses to each question may not add up to 100% if any participants respond “don't know” or values are missing. Calculating the percentage of people responding no to this question by subtracting the percentage of yes responses from 100% would therefore be inaccurate.

          Key population stigma is a negative stereotype based on an individual belonging to a key population group. Stigma is a well-documented barrier to the HIV care continuum, creating gaps across the prevention and treatment cascades, particularly for key populations (including sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs and transgender people). Key population stigma results from a range of drivers and facilitators, including: negative and judgmental attitudes towards key populations; shame related to an individual's ooccupation, drug use, or sexual and gender identity; and social, cultural and gender norms. These manifest in a range of stigmatizing practices and experiences, including discrimination, that deny key populations full social acceptance, consequently reducing their life chances, deterring them from accessing essential services and fuelling social inequalities.

          Reducing HIV stigma and discrimination experienced by key populations is critical for increasing HIV testing, uptake of and adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and viral suppression, all of which will improve their health outcomes.

          Method of measurement: Behavioural surveillance or other special surveys. This indicator is constructed based on the number of people who report that one or more of three experiences has happened to them in the last six months because of their key population status:

          - Have you ever felt excluded from family activities because you [sell sex; have sex with men; inject drugs; are transgender]? (no; yes, in the last six months; yes, but not in the last six months; don't know).

          - Has someone ever scolded you because you [sell sex; have sex with men; inject drugs; are transgender]? (no; yes, in the last six months; yes, but not in the last six months; don't know).

          - Has someone ever blackmailed you because you [sell sex; have sex with men; inject drugs; are transgender]? (no; yes, in the last six months; yes, but not in the last six months; don't know).

          - Key population stigma acts as a significant barrier to HIV care, manifesting through negative stereotypes and discrimination against specific groups like sex workers, men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, and transgender individuals.
          - Multiple factors drive this stigma, including societal attitudes, personal shame, and established social/cultural norms, which together create obstacles for accessing healthcare services and lead to social inequalities
          - The impact of stigma directly affects HIV treatment outcomes by deterring individuals from seeking testing, reducing adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and hampering viral suppression efforts

          Sex workers, gay men and other men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, transgender people and people in prisons and other closed settings typically have higher HIV prevalence than the general population in all  epidemic contexts. Addressing HIV among these populations is an important component of the national response.

          This indicator is calculated using data from HIV tests conducted by prisons and other closed settings. HIV testing programme data are acceptable.

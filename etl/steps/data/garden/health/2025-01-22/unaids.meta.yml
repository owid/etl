    Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has proven effective in lowering HIV-related illness and death rates among people living with HIV, as well as preventing the virus's transmission. Research indicates that starting treatment early, irrespective of an individual's CD4 cell count, maximizes benefits and saves lives. The World Health Organization (WHO) now advises ART for everyone diagnosed with HIV.

          The number of people dying from AIDS-related causes can be obtained using a variety of measures, including through a vital registration system adjusted for misreporting, as part of a facility- or population-based survey that may include verbal autopsy and through mathematical modelling using such tools as Spectrum. Modelling tools typically use demographic data, HIV prevalence from survey and surveillance, the number of people receiving antiretroviral therapy, HIV incidence and assumptions around survival patterns to estimate the number of people dying. In some instances, data from vital reporting systems and estimates of underreporting and misclassification also may be incorporated into these models to derive estimates of the number of AIDS-related deaths.

          The source of the estimate is requested. Countries providing the number of people dying from AIDS-related causes derived from a source other than Spectrum should provide any accompanying estimates of uncertainty around this number and upload an electronic copy of the report describing how the number was calculated.

          Countries should preferably report a modelled estimate rather than one derived from their vital registration system unless this system has been recently evaluated as one of high quality. Users can now opt to use their Spectrum estimate or enter nationally representative population-level data. If Spectrum estimates are chosen, the values will be pulled directly from the software once the national file is finalized.

        description_from_producer: |-
          The mother-to-child transmission probability differs with the antiretroviral drug regimen received and infant-feeding practices. The transmission can be calculated by using the Spectrum model.

          The Spectrum computer programme uses the information on:

          a. the distribution of HIV-positive pregnant women receiving different antiretroviral regimens prior to and during delivery (peripartum) by CD4 category of the mother
          b. the distribution of women and children receiving antiretrovirals after delivery (postpartum) by CD4 category of the mother.
          c. the percent of infants who are not breastfeeding in PMTCT programmes by age of the child
          d. mother-to-child transmission of HIV probabilities based on various categories of antiretroviral drug regimen and infant feeding practices

          The estimated national transmission rate is reported in the PMTCT summary display in Spectrum. This variable can also be calculated using the variables in Spectrum on “New HIV infections” for children 0-14 years and dividing this by the variable “Women in need of PMTCT”

          There is not enough information available about other HIV transmission routes for children to include such infections in the model. In addition other modes of transmission are believed to be a small fraction of the overall infections among children. The Spectrum output variable “New HIV infections for children 0-1 years” is not used because some infections due to breastfeeding will take place after age 1 year

          - The main goal of the global AIDS response is to reduce new HIV infections to below 200,000 by 2030. Monitoring the rate of new infections over time is essential to assess progress towards this target.
          - This indicator is a crucial metric in the WHO 2022 Consolidated guidelines on person-centered HIV strategic information.
        description_processing: |-
          Methods for monitoring incidence can vary depending on the epidemic setting and are typically categorized either as direct or indirect measures. Direct measurement at a population level is preferred but can often be difficult to obtain. As a result, most if not all countries rely on indirect measures or triangulate direct and indirect methods.

          Strategies for directly measuring HIV incidence include longitudinal follow-up and repeat testing among individuals who do not have HIV infection and estimation using a laboratory test for recent HIV infection and clinical data in the population. Longitudinal monitoring is often costly and difficult to perform at a population level. Laboratory testing of individuals to determine the recency of infection also raises cost and complexity challenges since a nationally representative population-based survey is typically required to obtain estimates.

          Indirect methods most frequently rely on estimates constructed from mathematical modelling tools, such as Spectrum or the AIDS Epidemic Model. These models may incorporate geographical and population-specific HIV surveys, surveillance, case reporting, mortality, programme and clinical data and, in some instances, assumptions about risk behavior and HIV transmission. In some instances, countries may wish to triangulate these data with other sources of estimates of the number of people newly infected, including from serial population-based HIV prevalence estimates or estimates of HIV prevalence in young, recently exposed populations.

          Note that case-based surveillance systems capturing newly reported people acquiring HIV infection should not be used as a direct source of estimating the number of people newly infected with HIV in the reporting year. Because of reporting delays and under-diagnosis, newly reported cases may not reflect the actual rate of people becoming newly infected. This information may be useful, however, for triangulation or validation purposes, especially when combined with tests for the recency of HIV infection.

          Disaggregated data reported for the numerator should be used to monitor progress towards eliminating new child infections and reducing the number of new HIV infections among adolescent girls and young women to below 100,000 per year.

          People living with HIV who know their HIV status will be able to access the HIV care and treatment services required to live healthy, productive lives and to reduce the potential of transmitting HIV to other people. The most effective way to ensure that people living with HIV are aware of their HIV status is to offer HIV testing services at locations and among populations with the highest HIV burden.

          People in prisons and other closed settings are often at risk for acquiring HIV when they are released and living in the community. This is especially true for people involved with illicit drug use or where selling sex is illegal. Offering HIV prevention and treatment services in prisons can reduce HIV transmission risk both within the prison and in the community on release. A strong national HIV response will include such services to people in prisons and other closed settings.

        description_from_producer: |-
          This indicator is key to assessing the availability and uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), especially among people at substantial risk of HIV infection. Through data disaggregation, this indicator will also attempt to monitor the availability and use by population (based on age, gender and key population). The use of antiretroviral medicines by people who are HIV-negative before they are exposed to HIV can prevent HIV infection. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that oral PrEP containing tenofovir (TDF) be offered as an additional prevention choice for people at substantial risk of HIV infection as part of combination HIV prevention approaches. In 2021, WHO recommended the dapivirine vaginal ring (DVR) as an additional PrEP option to be offered to cisgender women at substantial risk of HIV. In 2022, WHO recommended that long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA) may be offered as an additional PrEP option to people at substantial risk of HIV.

          In 2024, WHO updated the guidance on oral PrEP dosing regimens, which are determined by a combination of factors based on a person’scharacteristics, circumstances and route of exposure. The guidance no longer uses the term “event-driven PrEP” (ED-PrEP), given the variation possible within oral PrEP dosing.

          Implementation of PrEP should be informed by several contextual factors. These include national and subnational epidemiological trends; programmatic feasibility and demand; and consideration of the social environment for people living with HIV and people from key populations and their access to services. PrEP implementation criteria may vary by country.

          This indicator measures the performance of the TB program in ensuring that TB cases know their HIV status.

          Numerator: Number of new and relapsed TB cases with documented HIV status, during the reporting period
          Denominator: Total number of new and relapsed TB cases, during the reporting period

          The numerator and denominator can be obtained from basic management unit TB registers as well as additional data collection sources (i.e., HIV testing registers) that may contain relevant information (i.e., HIV test results, enrollment in HIV care programs). Programs should modify the register as needed to easily capture this information (<1 F, <1 M, 1-4 F, 1-4 M, 5-9 F, 5-9 M, 10-14 F, 10-14 M, 15-19 F, 15-19 M, 20-24 F, 20-24 M, 25-29 F, 25-29 M, 30-34 F, 30-34 M, 35-39 F, 35-39 M, 40-44 F, 40-44 M, 45-49 F, 45-49 M, 50+ F, 50+ M, Unknown age F, Unknown age M) and (Known HIV-positive at service entry).

          The data source is the TB register. There is a risk of double counting as TB patients could be tested multiple times during their TB treatment, therefore partners should ensure a data collection and reporting system is in place to minimize double counting. There is also a risk of undercounting if those patients who already knew their HIV status prior to attending TB clinic are not documented, therefore the TB register at a minimum should document “Known HIV-positive at service entry; Newly tested HIV-positive; Tested HIV negative.”

          This indicator measures the percentage of respondents that answered "YES" to all the responses below:

          1. Can the risk of HIV transmission be reduced by having sex with only one uninfected partner who has no other partners?
          2. Can a person reduce the risk of getting HIV by using a condom every time they have sex?
          3. Can a healthy-looking person have HIV?
          4. Can a person get HIV from mosquito bites?
          5. Can a person get HIV by sharing food with someone who is infected?

          The first three questions should not be altered. Questions 4 and 5 ask about local misconceptions and may be replaced by the most common misconceptions in your country. Examples include: “Can a person get HIV by hugging or shaking hands with a person who is infected?” and “Can a person get HIV through supernatural means?”

          Those who have never heard of HIV and AIDS should be excluded from the numerator but included in the denominator. An answer of “don’t know” should be recorded as an incorrect answer.

          Scores for each of the individual questions (based on the same denominator) are required as well as the score for the composite indicator.

          Three randomized controlled trials - plus post-trial studies - have shown that male circumcision provided by well-trained health professionals in properly equipped settings is safe and can reduce the risk of acquiring HIV. Other benefits of medical male circumcision include the reduced risk of some other STIs, including human papillomavirus, the cause of cervical cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS recommendations emphasize that voluntary medical male circumcision should be provided as part of a package of prevention interventions including safer sex education, condom education and provision, HIV testing and linkages to care and treatment, and management of sexually transmitted infections.

          WHO recommends that voluntary medical male circumcision should continue to be provided as an additional efficacious HIV prevention option within combination prevention for adolescents 15 years and older and adult men in settings with generalized epidemics. Decisions on offering voluntary medical male circumcision to younger adolescents 10-14 years must consider several factors based on new evidence, human rights and national and local context.

          Discrimination is a human rights violation and is prohibited by international human rights law and most national constitutions. In the context of HIV, discrimination refers to unfair or unjust treatment of an individual (either through actions or by failure to act) based on his or her real or perceived HIV status. Discrimination exacerbates risks and deprives people of their rights and entitlements, thus fueling the HIV epidemic.

          Stigma is the attribution of undesirable characteristics to an individual or group that reduces their status in the eyes of society. It frequently drives experiences of discrimination. The indicator measures HIV-related discrimination experienced in health-care settings. HIV is often associated with a range of behaviours that are viewed as socially deviant or immoral, such as injecting drug use and sexual promiscuity. Because of these underlying societal beliefs, people living with HIV often are viewed as shameful and are thought to be responsible for having contracted HIV. This shaming process has repercussions beyond the individual because it greatly reduces incentives to be tested for HIV or, in the event the test result is positive, to disclose HIV status to sexual partners or family members.

          The health sector is one of the main settings where people living with HIV—and those perceived to be living with HIV—experience discrimination. This indicator directly measures discrimination experienced by people living with HIV when seeking services in health-care settings.

          The composite indicator can be monitored as a measure of the prevalence of HIV-related discrimination experienced in the health sector by people living with HIV. This indicator could provide further understanding of HIV-related health outcomes and improve interventions to reduce and mitigate HIV-related stigma and discrimination experienced along the treatment and care cascade by (a) showing change over time in the percentage of people living with HIV who experience discrimination in health-care settings and (b) indicating priority areas for action.

          The indicator to be reported is total and subtotal HIV expenditures by services or programme categories and by financing sources. There are eight core sub-indicators that map to this reporting. These are outlined under Annex 3.

          By the end of 2020, the international and domestic resource availability for the HIV response reached an estimated US$ 21.5 billion (in constant 2019 dollars) in low- and middle-income countries. Achieving country and global targets requires increased focus, resources, programme effectiveness and efficiency to provide the HIV care, treatment and prevention to reduce HIV incidence and extend life.

          It is critical to identify long-term, sustainable financing sources, including domestic resource mobilization, to maintain and build upon the success achieved. However, filling the financing gap and pursuing efficient resource allocation can only be achieved by assessing and managing the resources available and their use.

          The quantification of financing flows and expenditures helps to examine the questions of who benefits from HIV programmes and to determine the current state of allocations for HIV programmes and services that focus on key or other specific populations.

          The vast majority of the AIDS Spending Categories (or ASCs, per National AIDS Spending Assessment [NASA] classifications) or the sub-indicators are drawn from existing frameworks and are now structured around the 2021 Political Declaration on Ending AIDS. The resource needs for low- and middle-income countries resulted in a target to mobilize at least US$ 29 billion (in constant 2019 US dollars) by 2025.

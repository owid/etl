          The number of people dying from AIDS-related causes can be obtained using a variety of measures,
          including through a vital registration system adjusted for misreporting, as part of a facility- or
          population-based survey that may include verbal autopsy and through mathematical modelling using such tools as Spectrum.
          Modelling tools typically use demographic data, HIV prevalence from survey and surveillance, the number of people
          receiving antiretroviral therapy, HIV incidence and assumptions around survival patterns to estimate the number of people dying.
          In some instances, data from vital reporting systems and estimates of underreporting and misclassification also may be
          incorporated into these models to derive estimates of the number of AIDS-related deaths.

          The source of the estimate is requested. Countries providing the number of people dying from AIDS-related causes derived from
          a source other than Spectrum should provide any accompanying estimates of uncertainty around this number and upload an
          electronic copy of the report describing how the number was calculated.

          Countries should preferably report a modelled estimate rather than one derived from their vital registration
          system unless this system has been recently evaluated as one of high quality. Users can now opt to use their
          Spectrum estimate or enter nationally representative population-level data. If Spectrum estimates are chosen,
          the values will be pulled directly from the software once the national file is finalized.

          HIV epidemics are perpetuated primarily through the sexual transmission of infection to successive generations
          of young people. Sound knowledge about HIV and AIDS is necessary (although often insufficient) for adopting
          behaviour that reduces the risk of HIV transmission.


          Method of measurement:

          Population-based surveys (Demographic and Health Survey, AIDS Indicator Survey, Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey or other
          representative survey)

          This indicator is constructed from responses to the following set of prompted questions. In particular, as the percentage of
          respondents 15–24 years old who correctly answered all five questions.


            1. Can the risk of HIV transmission be reduced by having sex with only one uninfected partner who has no other partners?

            2. Can a person reduce the risk of getting HIV by using a condom every time they have sex?

            3. Can a healthy-looking person have HIV?

            4. Can a person get HIV from mosquito bites?

            5. Can a person get HIV by sharing food with someone who is infected?


          The first three questions should not be altered. Questions 4 and 5 ask about local misconceptions and may be replaced by the most
          common misconceptions in your country. Examples include: “Can a person get HIV by hugging or shaking hands with a person who is
          infected?” and “Can a person get HIV through supernatural means?”

          Those who have never heard of HIV and AIDS should be excluded from the numerator but included in the denominator. An answer of
          “don’t know” should be recorded as an incorrect answer.

          Scores for each of the individual questions (based on the same denominator) are required as well as the score for the composite
          indicator.

      msm_condom_use:

        description_from_producer: >-
          Condoms can substantially reduce the risk of sexually transmitting HIV. Consistently and correctly using condoms is therefore
          important for men who have sex with men because of the high risk of HIV transmission during unprotected anal sex. In addition,
          men who have anal sex with other men may also have female partners, who could become infected as well. Condom use with the
          most recent male partner is considered a reliable indicator of longer-term behaviour.


          Note: countries with generalized epidemics may also have a concentrated subepidemic among gay men and other men
          who have sex with men. If so, calculating and reporting on this indicator for this population would be valuable.


          Method of measurement:

          Behavioural surveillance or other special surveys

          In a behavioural survey of a sample of gay men and other men who have sex with men, respondents are asked about sexual
          partnerships in the past six months, about anal sex within these partnerships and about condom use when they last had anal
          sex. Condom use applies whether the respondent is the receptive and insertive partner.

          Whenever possible, data for gay men and other men who have sex with men should be collected with civil society
          organizations that have worked closely with this population in the field.

          Access to gay men and other men who have sex with men and the data collected from them must remain confidential and secure.

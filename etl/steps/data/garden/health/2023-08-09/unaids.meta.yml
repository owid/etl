          The number of people dying from AIDS-related causes can be obtained using a variety of measures,
          including through a vital registration system adjusted for misreporting, as part of a facility- or
          population-based survey that may include verbal autopsy and through mathematical modelling using such tools as Spectrum.
          Modelling tools typically use demographic data, HIV prevalence from survey and surveillance, the number of people
          receiving antiretroviral therapy, HIV incidence and assumptions around survival patterns to estimate the number of people dying.
          In some instances, data from vital reporting systems and estimates of underreporting and misclassification also may be
          incorporated into these models to derive estimates of the number of AIDS-related deaths.

          The source of the estimate is requested. Countries providing the number of people dying from AIDS-related causes derived from
          a source other than Spectrum should provide any accompanying estimates of uncertainty around this number and upload an
          electronic copy of the report describing how the number was calculated.

          Countries should preferably report a modelled estimate rather than one derived from their vital registration
          system unless this system has been recently evaluated as one of high quality. Users can now opt to use their
          Spectrum estimate or enter nationally representative population-level data. If Spectrum estimates are chosen,
          the values will be pulled directly from the software once the national file is finalized.

          HIV expenditure by funding source.

        description_from_producer: >-
          The indicator to be reported is total and subtotal HIV expenditures by services or programme categories and by financing sources.
          There are eight core sub-indicators that map to this reporting. These are outlined under Annex 3.

          The calculation of each service/programme or sub-indicator may have individual characteristics to ensure proper accounting
          of all components (e.g., direct and shared costs of service provision) and to avoid double-counting; these calculations may
          be different by each financing source and service delivery modality (or even by service provider). Further guidance is
          available in the respective guidelines and manuals listed at the end of this section.

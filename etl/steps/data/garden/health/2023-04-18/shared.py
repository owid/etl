"""Utils (mostly mappings)

These are manually created, based on:

- "Guide to using the data": https://cms.wellcome.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/wgmdata-mental-health-data-dictionary-user-guide.docx (provides mapping of answer IDs to answer labels, only for MH* fields)
- "Full questionnaire":
    - WGM mental health 2020: https://cms.wellcome.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/WGM_Full_Questionnaire.pdf (based on order of answers, we manually map answer IDs to answer labels. Ideally WGM would provide a dictionary)
    - Need to complement with https://wellcome.org/reports/wellcome-global-monitor-covid-19/2020 (for the W* questions)

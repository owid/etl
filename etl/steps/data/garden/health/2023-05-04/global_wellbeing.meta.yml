      For its Life Evaluation Index, Gallup asks people to imagine a ladder, with the lowest rung representing the worst possible
      life and the highest rung representing the best possible life. Those rungs are numbered zero to 10, based on the Cantril
      Self-Anchoring Striving Scale (https://news.gallup.com/poll/122453/Understanding-Gallup-Uses-Cantril-Scale.aspx).
      People rate where they stand today and where they expect to stand in five years.


      Globally, Gallup has tracked life evaluations in at least 100 countries and areas each year since 2005, recording
      the highs and lows of how people have viewed their lives through major upheavals and changes -- including such events
      as Brexit, the Arab uprisings and the Euromaidan revolution. Since Gallup began tracking this in 2005, the percentage
      of the global population rating their lives highly enough to be considered thriving has ranged from a low of 21% in
      2009 to a high of 29% in 2020.


      In the U.S., Gallup has tracked the Life Evaluation Index as part of domestic polling since 2008, recording the
      highs and lows of Americans' perceptions of their lives through the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic,
      among other major events. Throughout that time, the percentage of Americans who are thriving has ranged from a
      low of 46% in November 2008 and April 2020 to a high of 59% in June 2021.

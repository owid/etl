    completion_date: |
      The clinical trials are sorted by their "completion date", which is the date when the clinical trial is has been completed.
    completed_trials: |
      This data comes from the [ClinicalTrials.gov](#dod:clinical-trials-gov) database. The dataset includes only clinical trials that have been marked as "completed" and have a valid "completion date".

dataset:
  update_period_days: 365 # dataset itself is updated continuously, but I think updating it every year is sufficient for us

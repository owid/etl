      This data comes from the [ClinicalTrials.gov](#dod:clinical-trials-gov) database. It only includes [interventional](#dod:interventional-trial) or [observational](#dod:observational-trial) clinical trials that are marked as "completed" and have a valid "completion date". [Expanded access studies](#dod:expanded-access), which provide access to investigational drugs or devices for patients with serious conditions, are not included in this data.

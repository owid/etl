          Share of the participants in the demographic group (country, age and gender) that marked a particular answer to the question.

          The share is obtained weighting the answers based on the characteristics of the participant. Data weighting is
          used to minimise bias in survey estimates and is intended to be used to generate nationally representative estimates within a country.
          The weighting procedure was formulated based on the sample design and performed in multiple stages.

          To learn more about this, you can read section "Data weighting" in chapter "I: Survey Methodology"

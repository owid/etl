        description_short: "[Global warming potential](#dod:gwp) measures the relative warming impact of one unit mass of a greenhouse gas relative to carbon dioxide."
        description_key:
        - Global warming potential (GWP) values are used to convert greenhouse gases into a carbon dioxide equivalent metric by multiplying emissions in mass terms by their respective GWP factors.
        - For example, a GWP value of 25 for a certain gas means that one tonne of that ags has 25 times the warming impact of one tonne of carbon dioxide.

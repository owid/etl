        description_short: GWP is given for different greenhouse gases relative to the GWP of carbon dioxide (denoted as 1).
        description_key:
        - GWP measures the relative warming impact of one unit mass of gas relative to one unit of carbon dioxide. For example, a GWP value for gas 'x' of 25 would mean one tonne of 'x' would have 25 times the warming impact of one tonne of carbon dioxide.
        - GWP values are used to convert greenhouse gases into a carbon dioxide equivalent metric by multiplying emissions in mass terms by their respective GWP factors.

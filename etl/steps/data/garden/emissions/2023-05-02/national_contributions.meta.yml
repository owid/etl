  title: National contributions to climate change (Jones et al. (2023), 2023)
  description: |
    Jones et al. (2023) quantify national and regional contributions to the increase of global mean surface temperature over the last few centuries.
    
    Original dataset description by Jones et al. (2023):
    A dataset describing the global warming response to national emissions CO2, CH4 and N2O from fossil and land use sources during 1851-2021.
    
    National CO2 emissions data are collated from the Global Carbon Project (Andrew and Peters, 2022; Friedlingstein et al., 2022). 
    
    National CH4 and N2O emissions data are collated from PRIMAP-hist (HISTTP) (Gütschow et al., 2022).
    
    We construct a time series of cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions for each country, gas, and emissions source (fossil or land use). Emissions of CH4 and N2O emissions are related to cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions using the Global Warming Potential (GWP*) approach, with best-estimates of the coefficients taken from the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al., 2021).
    
    Warming in response to cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions is estimated using the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE) approach, with best-estimate value of TCRE taken from the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al., 2021, Canadell et al., 2021). 'Warming' is specifically the change in global mean surface temperature (GMST).

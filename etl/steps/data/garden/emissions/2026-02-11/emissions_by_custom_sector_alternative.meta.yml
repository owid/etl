    Climate Watch's original subsectors are mapped into broader intermediate sectors, and summed to obtain direct emissions for each sector:
    - Agriculture: agriculture + land-use change and forestry.
    - Transport: transport.
    - Buildings: buildings.
    - Electricity: electricity/heat.
    - Industry: manufacturing/construction + industrial processes.
    - Other: other fuel combustion + waste + fugitive emissions.
  description_processing_indirect: |-
    Using UNdata's figures on final electricity consumption by sector, we calculate the share of total electricity consumed by each non-electricity sector (e.g. the fraction of total electricity used by buildings, by industry, etc.).

    Each sector's share of electricity consumption is then multiplied by the total emissions from electricity generation, yielding indirect emissions — the emissions attributable to the electricity each sector consumes.

    {definitions.description_processing_direct}

    {definitions.description_processing_indirect}

    Finally, direct and indirect emissions are summed to produce total emissions per sector, which reflect both on-site fuel combustion and the emissions embedded in electricity use.

      - Agriculture sector contains emissions from the following activities:
        - CH₄ emissions from Enteric fermentation (livestock).
        - CH₄ and N₂O emissions from Manure management (livestock).
        - CH₄ emissions from Rice cultivation.
        - N₂O emissions from Agriculture soils.
        - Crop residues.
        - Drained organic soils.
        - Manure applied to soils.
        - Manure left on pasture.
        - Synthetic fertilizers.
        - CH₄ and N₂O emissions from Other agricultural sources (burning of crop residues and savanna).

        Please note that emissions associated with agriculture related energy use are reported under Energy sector, and thus not included here.

      - Land-Use Change and Forestry sector contains emissions from the following activities:
        - CO₂ emissions from Forest land and Net forest conversion (forestland converted to cropland and grassland).
        - CO₂ emissions from Drained organic soils.
        - CO₂ and CH₄ emissions from Fires in organic soils.
        - CH₄ and N₂O emissions from Forest fires.

        Please note that the forest land emissions data reflects emissions from changes in forest land area between reported years of Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) submitted by countries. The data is published every 5 years, and emissions values are estimated by interpolating data over those 5-year periods.

        Please note recent change of FAO's approach for reporting emissions from fires in organic soils (part of the “Burning Biomass”): only values from Southern-east Asia countries are included in country, regional and global aggregates (of burning biomass and subsequently land use total).

      - Other fuel combustion subsector contains emissions from the following activities:
        - CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O emissions from Agriculture/forestry, fishing, and other fuel consumption.

        Other fuel consumption includes emissions from military fuel use.

      - Waste sector contains emissions from the following activities:
        - CH₄ from Landfills (including industrial and municipal solid waste).
        - CH₄ and N₂O from Wastewater treatment (rural and urban).
        - CH₄ and N₂O from Other waste sources.

      - Transportation subsector contains CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O emissions from the following activities:
        - Road.
        - Rail.
        - Domestic aviation.
        - Pipeline transport.
        - Domestic navigation.
        - Non-specified transport (all emissions from transport not specified elsewhere).

        Please note that transport emissions for world total includes international marine bunkers and international aviation bunkers, which are not included in transportation at a national or regional level.

      - Bunker fuels contain CO₂ emissions from international marine and aviation bunkers. The split of domestic and international are determined by the departure and landing locations, and not by the nationality of the ship/airline.

        Bunker Fuels are shown as a sector, but excluded from national totals for Energy (including energy subsector Transport) and Total GHG emissions, in accordance with IPCC Guidelines. In other words, except at World level, Total GHG emissions (and accordingly Energy sector, and Transport sub-sector emissions) do not include bunker fuel emissions.

      - Building subsector contains CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O emissions from the following activities:
        - Residential.
        - Commercial and public services.

        Please note that only on-site fuel combustion is covered here. Emissions associated with use of electricity are reported under electricity/heat.

      - Electricity/heat subsector contains CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O emissions from the following activities:
        - Main activity producer of electricity and heat (electricity plants, combined heat and power plants, heat plants).
        - Unallocated autoproducers.
        - Other energy industry own use.

        Please note that part of the emissions might be reallocated to industrial processes and product use category under the 2006 IPCC GLs.

      - Manufacturing/Construction subsector contains CO₂, CH₄ and N₂O emissions from the following activities:
        - Mining and quarrying.
        - Construction.
        - Manufacturing.
        - Iron and Steel.
        - Chemical and petrochemical.

        - Transport equipment.
        - Machinery.
        - Food and tobacco.
        - Paper, pulp and printing.
        - Wood and wood products.
        - Textile and leather.
        - Non-specified industry.

        Please note that part of the emissions might be reallocated to industrial processes and product use category under the 2006 IPCC GLs.

      - Industry sector contains emissions from the following activities:
        - CO₂ emissions from Cement Manufacture.
        - N₂O emissions from Adipic and Nitric Acid Production.

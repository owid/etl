"""
We need to have the share of emissions for the following custom list of broad sectors. Unfortunately, I haven't found a perfect mapping onto those categories from publicly available data.

Climate Watch (where we get our data for emissions by sector) has the following sectors:
Agriculture
Building
Bunker Fuels
Electricity/Heat
Fugitive Emissions
Industrial Processes
Land-Use Change and Forestry
Manufacturing/Construction
Other Fuel Combustion
Transportation
Waste

These don't map well to our desired categories (especially Electricity/Heat).

Climate Watch's data does have more granularity than this, but they don't provide access to the more granular data. What I will do is manually extract the percentages from this page:
https://www.wri.org/data/world-greenhouse-gas-emissions-sector-2021-sunburst-chart
which refers to 2021 (even though they have data for 2022, they haven't updated these visualizations yet).
Then, figure out a reasonable mapping of subsectors onto my custom categories.

          title: Area burnt by wildfires
          unit: hectares

          description_short: Area burnt by wildfires in hectares.
          description_key:
            - Area burnt by wildfires is determined using satellite imagery from high-resolution satellite imagery collected by MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite), which are instrumental in detecting thermal anomalies and changes in landscape patterns indicative of burning. These satellite systems, equipped with advanced sensors, capture detailed images that enable precise estimation of burnt areas, even in remote and inaccessible regions.

        pm2_5:
          title: PM2.5 emissions from wildfires
          unit: metric tons
          short_unit: MT
          description_short: Monthly PM2.5 emissions from fires represent the quantity of fine particulate matter (diameter less than 2.5 micrometers) released by fires.
          description_key:
            - Sources of emissions can include wildfires, agricultural burning, and prescribed burns.
            - PM2.5 can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract, affecting the lungs and potentially entering the bloodstream.
            - Exposure to PM2.5 is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular issues, and premature death in people with heart or lung disease.

          unit: metric tons
          short_unit: MT
          description_key:
          - Primary sources of emissions include wildfires, agricultural burning, and prescribed burns.
          - CO₂ emissions contribute to the greenhouse effect, influencing global warming and climate change.

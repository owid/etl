    - Wildfires are detected through the use of satellite imagery based on the NASA MCD64 MODIS product which offers global assessments of burned areas and fire occurrences. Although widely used, this product is known to consistently underestimate both the extent of burned areas and the frequency of fires. However, in terms of historical trends, it stands out as the most comprehensive dataset, offering the longest time series compared to other available options.

        title: Monthly CO₂ emissions from fires
        description_key:
        - Monthly CO₂ emissions from fires measure the carbon dioxide released by fires each month.
        - Primary sources include wildfires, agricultural burning, and prescribed burns.
        - CO₂ emissions contribute to the greenhouse effect, influencing global warming and climate change.

        title: Monthly PM2.5 emissions from fires
        description_key:
          - Monthly PM2.5 emissions from fires represent the quantity of fine particulate matter (diameter less than 2.5 micrometers) released by fires over a month.
          - Sources can include wildfires, agricultural burning, and prescribed burns.
          - PM2.5 can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract, affecting the lungs and potentially entering the bloodstream.
          - Exposure to PM2.5 is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular issues, and premature death in people with heart or lung disease.

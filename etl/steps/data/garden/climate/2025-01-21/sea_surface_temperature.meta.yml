       The 1961-90 period is most often used as a baseline because it is the period recommended by the World Meteorological Organisation. In some cases other periods are used. For global average temperatures, an 1861-1890 period is commonly used to show the warming since the "pre-industrial" period.
    description_processing: |-
      - We switch from using 1961-1990 to using 1861-1890 as our baseline to better show how temperatures have changed since pre-industrial times.
      - For each region, we calculate the mean temperature anomalies for 1961–1990 and for 1861–1890. The difference between these two means serves as the adjustment factor.
      - This factor is applied uniformly to both the temperature anomalies and the confidence intervals to ensure that both the central values and the associated uncertainty bounds are correctly shifted relative to the new 1861–1890 baseline.

        title: Monthly sea surface temperature anomalies
        description_short: The difference of average sea surface temperatures compared to the mean from 1861-1890, in degrees Celsius. This is measured at a depth of 20 centimeters.
        description_key:
        - Temperature anomalies show how many degrees Celsius temperatures have changed compared to the 1861-1890 period. This baseline period is commonly used to highlight the changes in temperature since pre-industrial times, prior to major human impacts.
        - The data includes separate measurements for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, which helps researchers analyze regional differences.
        - This data is based on the HadISST method. This method averages temperature measurements onto a fixed grid. If no data is available for a grid cell, it remains empty and adds extra uncertainty when calculating averages like the global mean.
        - Despite different approaches, HadISST and other methods show similar global temperature trends.

        title: Monthly sea surface temperature anomalies (lower bound)
        description_short: The lower bound, defined as the 95% confidence interval for the annual sea surface temperature anomalies, represents the deviation of the average sea surface temperature measured at a nominal depth of 20 cm from the 1861–1890 mean, in degrees Celsius.
        description_key:
          - The lower bound is the 95% confidence interval for the annual sea surface temperature anomalies. It represents the range of values within which the true value is expected to fall with 95% certainty.

        title: Monthly sea surface temperature anomalies (upper bound)
        description_short: The upper bound, defined as the 95% confidence interval for the annual sea surface temperature anomalies, represents the deviation of the average sea surface temperature measured at a nominal depth of 20 cm from the 1861–1890 mean, in degrees Celsius.
        description_key:
          - The upper bound is the 95% confidence interval for the annual sea surface temperature anomalies. It represents the range of values within which the true value is expected to fall with 95% certainty.

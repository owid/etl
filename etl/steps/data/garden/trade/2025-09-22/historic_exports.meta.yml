        title: Trade volume index (constant 1913 US$)
        unit: constant 1913 US$
        description_short: An index of world exports and imports, reconstructed from historical sources and standardized to modern definitions, expressed in constant 1913 prices (1913 = 100).
        description_key:
          - International trade has long been central to economic development.
            To trace its evolution, researchers compiled historical trade statistics
            from hundreds of sources, covering nearly all countries and colonies from
            1800 onward. While the UK began reporting as early as 1696, most systematic
            records only appeared in the 19th century, and each country used different
            methods.

          - To make figures comparable, the data were standardized to modern UN
            definitions. This meant excluding smuggling, re-exports, transit trade,
            and bullion; converting fiscal years to calendar years; and valuing
            imports including freight and exports excluding it. For regions without
            records, trade was estimated using partnersâ€™ data, nearby economies,
            or population-based proxies. All values were expressed in US dollars at
            constant 1913 prices, using detailed price indexes to adjust for inflation
            and shipping costs.

          - Because political borders shifted frequently as states unified or dissolved,
            the series is adjusted to 1913 boundaries to ensure consistency across time.
            Measuring trade over such a long period is inherently difficult, and
            differences in sources, definitions, and assumptions mean comparisons
            across centuries should be made with caution. Still, this reconstruction
            provides the most comprehensive long-term picture of world trade available.

        title: Trade volume index
        unit: index 1800=1
        description_short: World trade index, based on the average of exports and imports values, adjusted for inflation (1800 = 1).
        description_key:
          - One of the defining developments of the past two centuries has been the increasing integration of national economies into a single global system. This indicator illustrates the expansion of trade and the growing interconnectedness of the world economy since 1800.
          - It shows the volume of world trade, measuring the goods exchanged across national borders. To compare trade over time, researchers construct an index that averages exports and imports and set a baseline year (here, 1800 = 1) to track how global trade has evolved.
          - The historical component is based on [Federico & Tena-Junguito (2016)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10290-017-0279-z), who compiled trade statistics from hundreds of historical sources covering nearly every country and colony from 1800 to 1938, adjusting all estimates to 1913 borders. Their original index was expressed relative to 1913 = 100; here, we have re-indexed it so that 1800 = 1.
          - "Because definitions varied, the researchers standardized the historical data to modern UN conventions: smuggling, re-exports, transit trade, and bullion were excluded; fiscal years were aligned with calendar years; imports were valued including freight, and exports excluding it. Researchers used detailed price indexes to correct for inflation and shipping costs."
          - From 1950 onwards, we extend the series using data from the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO index was originally set to 1950 = 100, and we rescaled it to align with the historical series so that all data are expressed on the same 1800 = 1 scale. This allows us to present a consistent long-run view of world trade growth from 1800 to the present.
        description_processing: We combined historical trade data from Federico & Tena-Junguito (2016) (up to 1950) with World Trade Organization (WTO) data (from 1951 onwards). We re-indexed the Federico & Tena-Junguito series, originally expressed relative to 1913 = 100, so that 1800 = 1. We then rescaled the WTO index, originally set to 1950 = 100, using the 1950 overlap to align it with this 1800 = 1 scale. This ensures both series are presented consistently on the same baseline.

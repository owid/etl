      - Crime data can be difficult to compare between countries because of differences in how justice systems work, when the data is collected (for example, when a crime is first reported or after it has been investigated), and how international guidelines are used in each country.
      - Many crimes are never reported by victims, so the data cannot be used to measure exactly how common crime is. However, the data is still useful for spotting patterns and trends over time.
      - Most crime data come from records kept by the police or other law enforcement agencies. Countries vary in whether they record a crime when it is first reported, during an investigation, or after the investigation is finished.
      - In some countries, more than one agency collects crime data, and these different sets of data must be combined before they are published.

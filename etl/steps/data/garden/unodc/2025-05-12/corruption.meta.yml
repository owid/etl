      - Crime data is hard to compare between countries. Justice systems work differently, and countries vary in how and when they record crimes — whether it’s when the crime is first reported, during an investigation, or after it’s resolved. They also differ in how they apply international guidelines.
      - Many crimes are never reported, so official records don’t capture the full picture. That means we can’t use the data to measure exactly how common crime is. But it’s still valuable for spotting patterns and changes over time.
      - Most crime statistics come from police or other law enforcement agencies. In some countries, several agencies are involved, and their records can take time to be collected, processed, and published. This can mean that an arrest happening in one year may be prosecuted and convicted in later years.
      - Prosecution and conviction rates — especially for crimes like bribery — depend heavily on how strongly the law is enforced, how crimes are reported and recorded, and what society considers worth reporting. In places where bribery is normalised, it’s often not seen as serious enough to report.
      - Looking at trends within a country can still be useful, especially when law enforcement data is compared with survey data on [bribery prevalence](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/bribery-prevalence-un). But these trends can reflect more than just changes in crime itself. They might also reflect changes in policing, or in how willing people are to report crimes.

         Sweden revised its classification methodology in 2019 for the UN Crime Trends Survey (UN-CTS), with retroactive adjustments applied back to 2015. The revised figures from 2015 onwards include additional offense types such as "misuse of office/misconduct and unlawful disposal" that were not captured in earlier data collection periods. To ensure data consistency and comparability, pre-2015 data points from Sweden have been excluded.

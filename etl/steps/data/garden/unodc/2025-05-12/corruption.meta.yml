      - Crime data can be difficult to compare between countries because of differences in how justice systems work, when the data is collected (for example, when a crime is first reported or after it has been investigated), and how international guidelines are used in each country.
      - Many crimes are never reported by victims, so the data cannot be used to measure exactly how common crime is. However, the data is still useful for spotting patterns and trends over time.
      - Most crime data come from records kept by the police or other law enforcement agencies. Countries vary in whether they record a crime when it is first reported, during an investigation, or after the investigation is finished.
      - In some countries, more than one agency collects crime data, and these different sets of data must be combined before they are published.

         Sweden revised its classification methodology in 2019 for the UN Crime Trends Survey (UN-CTS), with retroactive adjustments applied back to 2015. The revised figures from 2015 onwards include additional offense types such as "misuse of office/misconduct and unlawful disposal" that were not captured in earlier data collection periods. To ensure data consistency and comparability, pre-2015 data points from Sweden have been excluded.

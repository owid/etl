        - Bribery cases progress slowly through justice systems, creating significant timing mismatches in the data. Individuals arrested in one year are typically prosecuted the following year and may not be convicted until several years later. This extended timeline means arrest and conviction data from the same year reflect entirely different groups of cases at different stages of the process, making direct comparisons misleading.
        - Each component of the justice system maintains separate recording systems that capture information at different stages and using different criteria. Police document cases when investigations begin, prosecutors when formal charges are filed, and courts when cases are heard and decided. These disconnected systems create data gaps that complicate efforts to track individual cases through the entire process from arrest to final disposition.
        - Bribery cases present unique prosecution challenges due to their inherent complexity. These crimes frequently involve sophisticated criminal networks, organized crime connections, and require specialized investigative resources and expertise that many justice systems lack. This complexity results in higher case attrition rates compared to conventional crimes, with more cases being dropped or dismissed at various stages of the process.
        - Countries employ different approaches to data collection, classification, and reporting that affect comparability. Some nations implement the "principal offence rule" where only the most serious crime is counted when multiple offenses occur together. Data completeness varies significantly across countries, and adherence to international reporting standards like the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS) remains inconsistent, leading to definitional and methodological differences.
        - Apparent anomalies in the data, such as prosecution rates exceeding arrest rates in certain countries, typically reflect these systematic data collection challenges rather than actual procedural irregularities. While these limitations affect direct cross-country comparisons, the data remains valuable for identifying patterns in justice system performance, resource allocation needs, and areas where prosecutorial capacity or training may require enhancement to effectively combat corruption.

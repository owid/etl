      - Crime and justice data can be affected by many factors, such as how a country’s justice system works, whether the data follow the “principal offence rule” (which means if a person commits more than one crime, it only counts once), how complete the data is, and how closely a country follows international standards for reporting.
      - Even though these differences exist, the data is still useful for understanding how criminal justice systems work in different countries.
      - The data is collected from official records kept by different parts of the justice system. The police usually record information about people who are suspected of, arrested for, or cautioned for a crime. Prosecutors collect data about people being charged, and the courts collect information about people who appear before them and those who are convicted.

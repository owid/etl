      - Justice data is hard to compare across countries and over time due to different legal systems, data collection methods, and reporting practices.
      - Cases move slowly through the justice system — arrests in one year typically lead to prosecutions the next year and convictions years later. This means arrest and conviction data from the same year reflect different groups of cases, making direct comparisons misleading.
      - Different agencies (police, prosecutors, courts) maintain separate records using different criteria, creating data gaps that make it difficult to track cases from arrest to final outcome.
      - Bribery cases are particularly complex, often involving criminal networks and requiring specialized expertise that many justice systems lack. This leads to higher case dismissal rates compared to other crimes.
      - Countries use different data collection approaches. Some apply the "principal offence rule" (counting only the most serious crime when multiple offenses occur together), and adherence to international standards like the [International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS)](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/statistics/iccs.html) varies significantly.
      - Apparent anomalies — such as prosecution rates exceeding arrest rates — typically reflect these data collection challenges rather than procedural irregularities.
      - Prosecution and conviction rates depend heavily on law enforcement intensity, reporting practices, and social norms. In places where bribery is normalized, it's often not considered serious enough to report.
      - Trends within countries can still be useful, especially when compared with survey data on [bribery prevalence](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/bribery-prevalence-un). However, these trends may reflect changes in policing or reporting willingness, not just actual crime levels.

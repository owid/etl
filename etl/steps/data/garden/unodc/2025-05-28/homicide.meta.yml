    description_processing: |-
      Values for the United Kingdom are calculated by Our World in Data from UNODC data for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

      Rates for the most recent year are calculated using medium population projection estimates from the United Nations World Population Prospects.
    description_key:
      - UNODC collects intentional homicide data from criminal justice systems (law enforcement records) and public health systems (death certificates).
      - "Intentional homicide requires three elements: one person killing another, intent to kill or seriously injure, and the act was illegal. For example, a person who kills another in self-defence is not considered to have committed an intentional homicide as justifiable homicide in self-defence is not illegal."
      - All killings that meet the criteria listed below are to be considered intentional homicides, irrespective of definitions provided by national legislations or practices.
      - Terrorist killings are included as intentional homicides.

    The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures inflation — how the average prices of goods and services change over time.

  cpi_base_1982_84: &cpi_base_1982_84 |-
    The index uses a base period of 1982–84, which is set to 100. Later values show how much prices have changed since then.
  cpi_base_dec_1997: &cpi_base_dec_1997 |-
    The index uses a base period of December 1997, which is set to 100. Later values show how much prices have changed since then.

          - This CPI item falls under “Tuition, other school fees, and childcare,” a subcategory of the broader Education index, and tracks out-of-pocket costs for tuition, school fees, and childcare.          - It's a subcategory of the broader "Tuition, other school fees, and childcare" which is part of the "Education" category.
          - It subtracts scholarships and grants, so the reported cost reflects what people really pay after financial aid.
          - Only degree-granting programs are included, such as associate’s, bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees.
          - Changes in the quality of education — like more instruction time — are difficult to measure, so most tuition increases are treated as simple price increases unless the reason for the change is very clear.

          - While quality adjustments are made when possible, most price changes are treated as inflation.
          - Overall, the category reflects how the cost of accessing education — from preschool to higher education — evolves over time.

        description_key:
          - *cpi_desc
          - The CPI's medical care category tracks out-of-pocket costs for health care services and products.
          - It includes expenses like doctor visits, hospital stays, dental care, and prescription drugs.
          - It does not include payments made by employers or the government.
          - When tracking price changes, it uses the full cost of care — including what insurance pays.
          - If a doctor visit costs $100 and the patient pays $20, the CPI still tracks the full $100.
          - This makes health care look smaller in the CPI than in the overall economy, because the CPI only uses personal spending to decide importance.

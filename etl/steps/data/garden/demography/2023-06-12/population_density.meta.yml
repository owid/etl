        title: Population density
        description_short: |
          Population per unit of area.
        description_processing: |-
          We have estimated the population density by using population estimates from multiple sources
          and land area estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

          We obtain it by dividing the population estimates by the land area estimates.
        unit: people per kmÂ²

      Twin births have risen dramatically since the 1980s. One reason is the use of reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), which have made it possible for many more couples to conceive. During procedures like IVF, multiple eggs can be used at the same time to maximize the chances of a successful pregnancy, which can lead to twin births.
    - |-
      Another reason for the rise in twin births is that the [average age of women at childbirth has risen](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/period-average-age-of-mothers-birth-order). Older women are [more likely to have twin births](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2015.00088.x), even without using reproductive technologies.
    - |-
      In some countries, twin birth rates have dropped in recent decades, as reproductive technologies have shifted to using single-embryo transfers instead of multiple.

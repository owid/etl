      The population time series is constructed by combining data from multiple sources:

      - 10,000 BCE - 1799: Historical estimates by HYDE (v3.3).

      - 1800 - 1949: Historical estimates by Gapminder (v7).

      - 1950-2023: Population records by the UN World Population Prospects (2024 revision).

      - 2024-2100: Projections based on Medium variant by the UN World Population Prospects (2024 revision).

          We have estimated the population density by using population estimates from multiple sources
          and land area estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

          We obtain it by dividing the population estimates by the land area estimates.

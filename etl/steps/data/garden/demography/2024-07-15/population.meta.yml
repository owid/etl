      ### Combination of different sources
      We construct our long-run population data by combining multiple sources:

      - 10,000 BCE–1799: historical estimates by HYDE (v3.3).

      - 1800–1949: historical estimates by Gapminder (v7).

      - 1950–2023: population records from the United Nations World Population Prospects (2024 revision).

      ### Combination of different sources
      We construct our long-run data by combining multiple sources:

      - 10,000 BCE–1799: historical estimates by HYDE (v3.3). Growth rate estimated over 50-year periods.

      - 1800–1949: historical estimates by Gapminder (v7). Growth rate estimated over 50-year periods until 1900, then 10-year periods.

      - 1950–2023: population records from the United Nations World Population Prospects (2024 revision). Growth rate estimated over 1-year periods.

    regional_aggregates_processing: |-
      **Geographical aggregates**

      - For most years, we calculate aggregates by summing the population of member countries.
      - We do this based on [our definition of continents](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions#our-world-in-data) and the [World Bank’s income groups](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-bank-income-groups).
      - The only exception is before 1800, where we use HYDE's estimates for continents (but not income groups).

      For most of the years, we've estimated regional aggregates by summing the population of countries in each region. We've relied on [our continents](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions#our-world-in-data) and [World Bank income group definitions](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-bank-income-groups). The only exception is before 1800, where we've used HYDE's estimates on continents (but not income groups).

      **World**
      - Before 1800: we use data from HYDE.
      - 1800-1950: we estimate the global population by summing all available countries in the dataset.
      - After 1950, we rely on estimates from the United Nations World Population Prospects.

          - Population is the most commonly used metric throughout Our World in Data. It is used directly to understand population growth over time, and indirectly to calculate per-capita indicators, making it easier to compare countries of different sizes.
          - |-
            We construct this indicator by combining multiple sources covering different periods.
              - HYDE v3.3 (2023): historical estimates from 10,000 BCE to 1799.
              - Gapminder v7 (2022): for 1800-1949.
              - UN World Population Prospects (2024): for 1950 onwards, including 2100 projections.
              - Gapminder Systema Globalis (2023): additional source for former countries (Yugoslavia, USSR, etc.)
          - Breaks in the data may occur at the boundaries between sources due to their methodological differences.
          - You can read more about the sources and methodology in our [dedicated article](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources). We also provide a table of sources showing the source we use for each country-year.
          - We calculate geographical aggregates (continents, income groups, etc.) by summing individual country populations. For years before 1800, we rely directly on HYDE's values for continents to ensure historical consistency.

          We have estimated the population density by using population estimates from multiple sources and land area estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

          We obtain it by dividing the population estimates by the land area estimates.

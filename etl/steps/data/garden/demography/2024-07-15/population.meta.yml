      ### Regional aggregates

      **Continents and other region aggregates**:

      For most of the years, we've estimated regional aggregates by summing the population of countries in each region. We've relied on [our continents](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions#our-world-in-data) and [World Bank income group definitions](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-bank-income-groups). The only exception is before 1800, where we've used HYDE's estimates on continents (but not income groups).

      **World**:
      - Before 1800: We've used HYDE's estimates.
      - 1800-1950: We've estimated the World population by summing all available countries in the dataset, ensuring that we do not double-count any country.
      - After 1950: We've relied on UN WPP's estimates.

      ### Combination of different sources
      The population data is constructed by combining data from multiple sources:

      - 10,000 BCE - 1799: Historical estimates by HYDE (v3.3).

      - 1800 - 1949: Historical estimates by Gapminder (v7).

      - 1950-2023: Population records by the UN World Population Prospects (2024 revision).

      - 2024-2100: Projections based on Medium variant by the UN World Population Prospects (2024 revision).

          - Population is the most commonly used metric throughout Our World in Data. It is used directly to understand population growth over time or indirectly to calculate per-capita adjustments, which enables meaningful comparisons between countries of different sizes.
          - |-
            This indicator has been constructed by combining data from multiple sources, each covering different time periods.
              - Sources used: HYDE v3.3 (2023) for historical estimates from 10,000 BCE to 1799; Gapminder v7 (2022) for 1800-1949; UN World Population Prospects (2024) for 1950 onwards; Gapminder Systema Globalis (2023) for data on former countries (Yugoslavia, USSR, etc.)
              - Discontinuities may occur at the boundaries between data sources due to methodological differences in data collection and estimation procedures.
              - You can read more about the sources and methodology in our [Population Sources article](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources). We also provide a [table of sources](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sources-population-dataset) that shows the source for each country-year in the dataset.
          - Our regional aggregates are calculated by summing individual country populations, except for pre-1800 continental estimates where we rely on HYDE's original regional data to ensure historical consistency.

          We have estimated the population density by using population estimates from multiple sources and land area estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

          We obtain it by dividing the population estimates by the land area estimates.

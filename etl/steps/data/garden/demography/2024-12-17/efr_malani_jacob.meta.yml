        title: Reproductive Effective Fertility rate (scaled by sex ratio)
        description_short: |-
          The number of daughters that live long enough to reproduce, between ages 15 and 49. This focuses on daughters, not all children because only females reproduce. Because a child need not live until age 49 to reproduce, we approximate efr_r by taking the average of efr over all reproductive ages (15-49).
        unit: "children per women"

          For a given cohort year, we estimate the cumulative survival probability for a person to reach each age from 0 to 49. For example, the probability of a person born in 2000 reaching age 15, 16, 17, and so on up to 49.

          We then estimate the Effective Fertility Rate (EFR) for each age group by multiplying the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) by the cumulative survival probability. The EFR for a given age gives us an approximation of the average number of children from a woman that will live long enough to reach that age.

          The Reproductive Effective Fertility rate (EFR) is the average of the EFR over all reproductive ages (15-49).

          Note that the Reproductive Effective Fertility rate (EFR) is an approximation of the number of daughters, so it uses the total fertility rate of female children, or equivalently, the TFR weighted by the sex ratio at birth.

          So we have that: EFR_repr = (TFR * mean(EFR)) / (1 + SRB), where SRB is the male-to-female ratio and the mean is taken over all reproductive ages (15-49).

          This indicator is scaled by the sex ratio to allow easy comparability with the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) and the Labor Effective Fertility rate (EFR_labor).

      efr_labor:
        title: Labor Effective Fertility rate
        description_short: |-
          The number of children born in a year who will live long enough to earn labor income. This is approximated this by taking the average of Effective Fertility rate (EFR) over all working ages (15-65).
        unit: "children per women"
        description_processing: |-
          For a given cohort year, we estimate the cumulative survival probability for a person to reach each age age from 0 to 65. E.g. the probability of a person born in 2000 to reach age 15, 16, 17, ..., 65.

          We then estimate the Effective Fertility Rate (EFR) for each age group by multiplying the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) by the cumulative survival probability. The EFR for a given age gives us an approximation of the average number of children from a women that will live long enough to reach that age.

          The Labor Effective Fertility rate (EFR) is the average of the EFR over all labor ages (15-65).

          So we have that: EFR_labor = (TFR * mean(EFR)), where the mean is taken over all labor ages (15-65).

          The probability that a person born in a given year will live long enough to reach reproductive age (15-49).
        description_processing: |-
          For a given cohort year, we estimate the cumulative survival probability for a person to reach each age from 0 to 49. For example, the probability of a person born in 2000 reaching age 15, 16, 17, and so on up to 49.

          This is done by multiplying the survival probability at various years, depending on the age of the person. For example, if born in 2000, we use the probability of surviving age 0 from 2000, the probability of surviving age 1 from 2001, etc.

  title: Life Expectancy (various sources)
  description:
    "This dataset has been created using multiple sources. We use UN WPP\
    \ for data since 1950 (estimates and medium variant). Prior to that, other sources\
    \ are combined.\n\n------\n\nWorld Population Prospects - UN (2022):\n\nWorld\
    \ Population Prospects 2022 is the 27th edition of the official estimates and\
    \ projections of the global population that have been published by the United\
    \ Nations since 1951. The estimates are based on all available sources of data\
    \ on population size and levels of fertility, mortality and international migration\
    \ for 237 countries or areas. More details at https://population.un.org/wpp/Publications/.\n\
    \n------\n\nLife Tables - Human Mortality Database (2022-11-04):\n\nTo facilitate\
    \ rapid downloads, the database has been organized into zipped data files. Two\
    \ series of files are intended for different purposes and for different users.\n\
    For users who want to obtain all available data for an individual country or for\
    \ all countries, the zipped data files labeled \"By country\" are recommended.\
    \ The file \norganization follows internal practices and is not particularly user-friendly,\
    \ but all publicly-available HMD data are included in this set.\nFor users who\
    \ only want information of a given kind for all countries, the files \"By statistic\"\
    \ are recommended. In this case the file organization is simpler, \nbut only certain\
    \ parts of the database (i.e., items labeled \"Complete Data Series\" on country\
    \ pages) are available in this format.\n\nMore details can be found at https://www.mortality.org/Data/ExplanatoryNotes.\n\
    \n\n------\n\nLife Expectancy at Birth (Total) - Zijdeman et al. (2015):\n\nThis\
    \ dataset provides Period Life Expectancy at birth per country and year. The overall\
    \ aim of the dataset is to cover the entire world for the period 1500-2000.\n\
    The current version (version 2) was build as part of the OECD \"How was life\"\
    \ project. The dataset has nearly global coverage for the post 1950 period, while\
    \ pre \n1950 the coverage decreases the more historic the time period. Depending\
    \ on sources, the data are annual estimates, 5 yearly or decadel estimates\n\n\
    The sources used are:\n\n- <a href=\"http://esa.un.org/wpp/\">UN World Population\
    \ Project</a>.\n- <a href=\"Human Mortality Database\">http://www.mortality.org</a>.\n\

    \n\n------\n\nEstimates of Regional and Global Life Expectancy, 1800-2001 - Riley\
    \ (2005):\n\nHistorians and demographers have gone to considerable trouble to\
    \ reconstruct life expectancy in the past in individual countries.\n\nThis overview\
    \ collects information from a large body of that work and links estimates for\
    \ historical populations to those provided by the United Nations, the World Bank,\
    \ and other sources for 1950â€“2001. The result is a picture of regional and global\
    \ life expectancy  at birth for selected years from 1800 to 2001. The bibliography\
    \ of more than 700 sources is published separately on the web.\n\nContinents definitions\
    \ may differ from OWID's definitions. The individual countries included are those\
    \ that had populations in 2000 of at least 400,000, plus Iceland. Smaller countries\
    \ have been excluded chiefly because of the difficulty of finding estimates for\
    \ life expectancy before the 1940s. For 2001 the population included in the estimates\
    \ is 99.6 percent of the total midyear world population.\n\nFor more details please\
    \ read the 'Notes' section from the source.\n\n\n------\n\n"

          The age until which the 1st percentile (99% of the population) of the population would survive until, if they experienced the same age-specific death rates throughout their whole lives as the age-specific death rates seen in that particular year.

          This was calculated with the method published in Alvarez and Vaupel (2023), with code provided by the authors:

          Jesús-Adrián Alvarez, James W. Vaupel; Mortality as a Function of Survival. Demography 1 February 2023; 60 (1): 327–342. doi: https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-10429097

          These estimates were regenerated for data from more recent years in the Human Mortality Database.

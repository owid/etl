      <% if scenario == "1" %>
      **Population Component of Rapid Development (SSP1)**: This scenario assumes a future that is moving toward a more sustainable path, with educational and health investments accelerating the demographic transition, leading to a relatively low world population. The emphasis is on strengthening human wellbeing. This is associated with high education, low mortality and low fertility. Migration levels are assumed to be medium for all countries under this SSP.
      <%- elif scenario == "2" %>
      **Population Component of Medium (SSP2)**: This is the middle of the road scenario that can also be seen as the most likely path for each country. It combines for all countries medium fertility with medium mortality, medium migration, and the Global Education Trend (GET) education scenario.
      <%- elif scenario == "3" %>
      **Population Component of Stalled Development (SSP3)**: This scenario portrays a world separated into regions characterized by extreme poverty, pockets of moderate wealth, and many countries struggling to maintain living standards for rapidly growing populations. This is associated with low education, high mortality and high fertility. Due to the emphasis on security and barriers to international exchange, migration is assumed to be low for all countries.
      <%- elif scenario == "4" %>
      **Population Component of Inequality (SSP4)**: This scenario assumes increasing inequalities and stratification both across and within countries. It assumes high fertility and mortality scenarios in high-fertility countries and low fertility and medium mortality scenarios in low-fertility countries combined with medium migration scenario. In terms of education the SSP3 education transitions (CER) are decreased by 10% for levels up to lower secondary education, keeping the SSP2 (GET) education transitions for upper and post-secondary education.
      <%- elif scenario == "5" %>
      **Population Component of Conventional Development (SSP5)**: This scenario is similar to SSP1 for the fertility, mortality and education assumptions except that it combines them with high migration scenario in a context of widespread globalization.

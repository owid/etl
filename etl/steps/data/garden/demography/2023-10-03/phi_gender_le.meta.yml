        unit: "%"

        description_short: |-
          The probability that a male will outsurvive a female if both are randomly selected from the population at birth.
        description_processing: |-
          This indicator is estimated using the Equation 2 from:

          Bergeron-Boucher, M.-P., Alvarez, J.-A., Kashnitsky, I., & Zarulli, V. (2022). Probability of males to outlive females: An international comparison from 1751 to 2020. BMJ Open, 12(8), e059964. https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059964

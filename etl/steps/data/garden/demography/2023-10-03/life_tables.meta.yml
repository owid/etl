      central_death_rate:
        title: Central death rate
        description_short: |-
          The number of people who died during a 12-month period while at a given age by the average number who were living in that age group during this period.
        unit: deaths per 1,000 people
        processing_level: minor
        description_processing: |-
          The original metric is given as a score between 0 and 1 (i.e. per-capita). We multiply this by 1,000 to get a per-1,000 people rate.
      probability_of_death:
        title: Probability of death
        unit: "%"
        description_short: The probability that a person who survived until the start of a given interval will have died by the end of the interval.
        processing_level: minor
        description_processing: |-
          The original metric is given as a score between 0 and 1 (i.e. per-capita). We multiply this by 100 to get a percentage.
      average_survival_length:
        title: Average survival length
        short_unit: years
        unit: years
        description_short: Average length of survival between ages x and x+n for persons dying in the interval.
      number_survivors:
        title: Number of survivors
        unit: survivors
        description_short: Number of survivors at a given age, assuming survivors at 0 years old is 100,000.
      number_deaths:
        title: Number of deaths
        short_unit: deaths
        unit: deaths
        description_short: Number of deaths between during a given age.
      number_person_years_lived:
        title: Number of person-years lived
        unit: person-years
        description_short: Number of person-years lived between a given ages and a year after.
      number_person_years_remaining:
        title: Number of person-years remaining
        unit: person-years
        description_short: Number of person-years remaining after a given age.
      life_expectancy:
        title: Life expectancy
        short_unit: years
        unit: years
        description_short: |-
          <% if type == "period" %>
          The average number of years a person is expected to live, based on mortality rates seen across all age groups in a given interval.
          <% elif type == "cohort" %>
          The average number of years that individuals born in a given interval actually lived, based on tracking that birth cohort over time.
          <% endif %>
        description_key:
          - Life expectancy at age 0 refers to life expectancy at birth. For other ages, it refers to the remaining life expectancy people who have already survived to the given age.
      life_expectancy_fm_diff:
        title: Life expectancy difference (f-m)
        short_unit: years
        unit: years
        description_short: Life expectancy difference (females - males) at a given age.
      life_expectancy_fm_ratio:
        title: Life expectancy ratio (f/m)

        <% if type == "period" %>
        The average number of years a person is expected to live, based on mortality rates seen across all age groups in a given interval.
        <% elif type == "cohort" %>
        The average number of years that individuals born in a given interval actually lived, based on tracking that birth cohort over time.

        <% if type == "period" %>
        This is based on a synthetic cohort created using mortality rates across age groups in a given year.
        <% elif type == "cohort" %>
        Rather than waiting for the entire cohort to have died before calculating the cohort life expectancy, researchers may use data from birth cohorts that are 'almost extinct'.

      Prior to 1950, we use HMD (2023) data. From 1950 onwards, we use UN WPP (2022) data.

    Life tables from UN and HMD.

    For period data, data prior to 1950 is from HMD, and data from 1950 onwards is from UN WPP.

      central_death_rate:
        title: Central death rate
        description_short: |-
          For a given population or cohort, the central death rate during a given 12 month interval is calculated as the number of deaths during the interval, divided by the number of person-years lived during that interval.
        description_key:
          - |-
            Person-years refers to the combined total time that a group of people has lived. For example, if 10 people each live for 2 years, they collectively contribute 20 person-years. This makes the value very slightly different from the 'probability of death' during the interval, because the 'probability of death' metric uses a different denominator: the number of people alive at that age at the start of the interval.

        unit: deaths per 1,000 people
        processing_level: minor
        description_processing: |-
          The original metric is given as a fraction between 0 and 1 (i.e. per-capita). We multiply this by 1,000 to get a per-1,000 people rate.
      probability_of_death:
        title: Probability of death
        unit: "%"
        description_short: |-
          The probability of dying in a given interval, among people who survived to the start of that interval.
        description_key:
          - |-
            For example, the probability of death for a 50 year old in a given year is found by: dividing the number of deaths in 50 year olds that year, by the number of people alive at the age of 50 at the start of the year.
        processing_level: minor
        description_processing: |-
          The original metric is given as a fraction between 0 and 1 (i.e. per-capita). We multiply this by 100 to get a percentage.

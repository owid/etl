          The population time series is constructed by combining data from multiple sources:

          • 10,000 BCE - 1799: Historical estimates by HYDE (v3.2). Includes some data from Gapminder (Systema Globalis).

          • 1800-1949: Historical estimates by Gapminder. Includes some data from HYDE (v3.2) and Gapminder (Systema Globalis).

          • 1950-2021: Population records by the UN World Population Prospects (2022 revision). Includes some data from HYDE (v3.2), Gapminder (Systema Globalis) and Gapminder (v7).

          • 2022-2100: Projections based on Medium variant by the UN World Population Prospects (2022 revision).

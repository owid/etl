  title: Population (various sources, 2023.1)
  description: &dataset-description >-
    This dataset has been created using multiple sources:


    • UN WPP (2022): Covers the period 1950-2100. Future projections are based on the Medium variant.

    • Gapminder (v7): Mostly covers the period 1800-1949. In addition, it complements the dataset with population data for the
    "Vatican" until 2100 (it is missing in UN WPP's estimates).

    • HYDE (v3.2): Mostly covers the period 10,000 BCE - 1799. In addition, it complements the dataset with population for some countries
    outside of this year period. E.g. it provides data for "Svalbard and Jan Mayen" (until 2017) and "Netherlands Antilles" (until 2010).

    • Gapminder (v7): Mostly covers the period 1800-1949. In addition, it complements the dataset with population data for the "Vatican" until 2100 (it is missing in UN WPP's estimates).

    • HYDE (v3.2): Mostly covers the period 10,000 BCE - 1799. In addition, it complements the dataset with population for
    some countries outside of this year period. E.g. it provides data for "Svalbard and Jan Mayen" (until 2017) and "Netherlands Antilles" (until 2010).

    • Gapminder (Systema Globalis): Covers the period 1555-2008. It complements the dataset with former countries and other data points not present in the other sources.

      Our World in Data builds and maintains a long-run dataset on population by country, region, and for the world, based on three key sources: HYDE, Gapminder, and the UN World Population Prospects.

      You can find more information on these sources and how our time series is constructed on this page: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources">What sources do we rely on for population estimates?</a>

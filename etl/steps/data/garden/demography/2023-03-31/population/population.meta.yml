    The population time series has been built using various sources:

    • [United Nations - World Population Prospects (2022)](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/): Covers the period 1950-2100. Future projections are based on the Medium variant.

    • [HYDE v3.2 (2017)](https://public.yoda.uu.nl/geo/UU01/MO2FF3.html): Mostly covers the period 10,000 BCE - 1799. In addition, it complements the dataset with population for some countries outside of this year period. For example, it provides data for "Svalbard and Jan Mayen" (until 2017) and "Netherlands Antilles" (until 2010).

    • [Gapminder - Population v7 (2022)](https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd003/): Mostly covers the period 1800-1949. In addition, it complements the dataset with population data for the "Vatican" until 2100 (it is missing in UN WPP's estimates).

    • [Gapminder - Systema Globalis (2023)](https://github.com/open-numbers/ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis): Covers the period 1555-2008. It complements the dataset with former countries and other data not present in the other sources.

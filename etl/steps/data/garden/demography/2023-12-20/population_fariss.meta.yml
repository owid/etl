    variables:
      population:
        title: Population (mean estimate)

        description_short: The total number of people living in a country.

      population_high:
        title: Population (high estimate)
        unit: people

          See complete methodology in https://doi.org/10.1177/00220027211054432.

          The high estimate is calculated by adding the standard deviation to the mean estimate.

      population_low:
        title: Population (low estimate)
        unit: people
        description_short: Low estimate on the total number of people living in a country.
        description_processing: |-
          See complete methodology in https://doi.org/10.1177/00220027211054432.

          The low estimate is calculated by subtracting the standard deviation from the mean estimate.

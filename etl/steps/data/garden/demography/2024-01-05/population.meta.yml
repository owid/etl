      The population time series is constructed by combining data from multiple sources:

      - 10,000 BCE - 1959: Historical estimates by HYDE (v3.3).

      - 1950-2021: Population records by the UN World Population Prospects (2022 revision).

      - 2022-2100: Projections based on Medium variant by the UN World Population Prospects (2022 revision).

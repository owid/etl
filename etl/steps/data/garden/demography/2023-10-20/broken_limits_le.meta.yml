          - Period life expectancy is a metric that summarizes death rates across all age groups in one particular year. For a given year, it represents the average lifespan for a hypothetical group of people, if they experienced the same age-specific death rates throughout their lives as the age-specific death rates seen in that particular year.
          - Records are only shown for countries in the Human Mortality Database. Prior to 1950, we use HMD (2023) data. From 1950 onwards, we use UN WPP (2022) data.

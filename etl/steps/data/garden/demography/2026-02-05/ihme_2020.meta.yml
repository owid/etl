    description_key:
      - This data combines IHME's past estimates with their reference scenario projections.
      - Projections are based on forecasts of key drivers including education of females and access to modern reproductive health services.

          Estimated total population of a country or region.

          - This indicator reflects the mean estimate, and relies on IHME's "reference" scenario for data after 2018 (included).
          - The "reference" scenario is the baseline forecast obtained when projecting forward using IHME's main statistical models and the continuation of recent, location-specific trends in the key drivers.

        unit: migrants
        short_unit: ""
        description_short: The number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants over a given period.
        description_key:
          - Migration is forecasted once (with uncertainty) and then used as an input in all population projections; In other words, IHME's scenarios always use the same migration estimates. As a result, migration forecasts may have large uncertainty intervals.

          The average number of live births a hypothetical cohort of women would have at the end of their reproductive period if they were subject during their whole lives to the fertility rates of a given period and if they were not subject to mortality.

          - Assumes current age-specific fertility rates remain constant throughout a woman's lifetime.
          - Does not account for potential changes in social, economic, or health conditions that could affect fertility rates.

          The fertility data is constructed by combining data from multiple sources:

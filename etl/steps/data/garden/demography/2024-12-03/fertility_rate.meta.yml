        description_short: |-
          The average number of live births a hypothetical cohort of women would have at the end of their reproductive period if they were subject during their whole lives to the fertility rates of a given period and if they were not subject to mortality. {definitions.global.dimensions.description_short}
        description_key:
          - Assumes current age-specific fertility rates remain constant throughout a woman's lifetime.
          - Does not account for potential changes in social, economic, or health conditions that could affect fertility rates.

          The fertility data is constructed by combining data from multiple sources:

          - 1800 - 1949: Historical estimates by Human Fertility Database (2024).

          - 1950-2023: Population records by the UN World Population Prospects (2024 revision).

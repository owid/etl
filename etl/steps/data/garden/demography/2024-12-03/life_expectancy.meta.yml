      Prior to 1950, we used the Human Mortality Database (2024) data combined with Zijdeman (2015). For historical regional data, before 1950, we used Riley's (2005) estimates. From 1950 onwards, we used United Nations World Population Prospects (2024) data.

      Prior to 1950, we use HMD (2024) data. From 1950 onwards, we use UN WPP (2024) data.

      Period life expectancy is a metric that summarizes death rates across all age groups in one particular year.
    point_2: |-
      <%- if age == '0' -%>
      It shows how long the average baby born in that year would be expected to live if they experienced the same chances of dying at each age as people did in that year.
      <%- else -%>
      For a given year, it represents the remaining average lifespan for a hypothetical group of people, if they experienced the same age-specific death rates throughout the rest of their lives as the age-specific death rates seen in that particular year.

        description_short: The [period life expectancy](#dod:period-life-expectancy) at birth, in a given year. Period life expectancy shows how long the average person born in a certain year would live if they experienced the same chances of dying at each age as people did in that year.
        description_key:
          - Across the world, people are living longer. In 1900, the global average life expectancy of a newborn was 32 years. By 2021, this had more than doubled to 71 years.
          - Big improvements were achieved by countries [around the world](https://ourworldindata.org/#:~:text=achieved%20by%20countries-,around%20the%20world,-.%20The%20chart%20shows). The chart shows that life expectancy has more than doubled in every region of the world. This improvement is not only due to declining child mortality; life expectancy increased [at all ages](https://ourworldindata.org/#:~:text=life%20expectancy%20increased-,at%20all%20ages,-.).
          - This visualization shows long-run estimates of life expectancy brought together by our team from several different data sources. It also shows that the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://ourworldindata.org/#:~:text=shows%20that%20the-,COVID%2D19%20pandemic,-led%20to%20reduced) led to reduced life expectancy worldwide.

          This chart is a combination of several data sources which we join together. For historical country-level data we use the Human Mortality Database (2024) data combined with Zijdeman et al. (2015).

          For historical regional data, before 1950, we use Riley's (2005) estimates. From 1950 onwards, we use United Nations World Population Prospects (2024) data. The countries included in the regions follow Riley (2005) until 1950 and UN WPP afterwards.

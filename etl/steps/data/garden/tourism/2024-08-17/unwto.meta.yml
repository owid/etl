      - When an individual visits a country multiple times within a year, each visit is counted as a separate arrival.
      - Similarly, if a person travels to multiple countries during a single trip, their arrival in each country is recorded individually.
      - As a result, the number of arrivals does not necessarily reflect the number of individuals traveling, as one person can generate multiple arrivals.
      - Note that before 2006, the US counted same-day trips from Canada only. After 2006, day trips from Mexico were also included.

          - *desc_key_departures
          - Per "1,000 people" in the context of international tourist departures refers to the calculation of departures per 1,000 individuals within the population of the country.
          - This approach enables standardized comparison and analysis of data or rates, ensuring consistency across different population sizes.
          - For instance, if there are "10 tourist departures per 1,000 people," it means that among every 1,000 individuals in the population, there are 10 instances of international departures by people who travel abroad and stay overnight.
          - This indicator provides an insight into the level of international tourism in the country of reference.

          - The underlying premise behind this indicator is that the country linked to the arrival should correspond to the individual's country of residence.
          - However, it is worth noting that certain countries deviate from UNWTO recommendations and classify their nationals residing abroad as a distinct category, rather than considering them as residents of those countries.

          - When reporting a time series of expenditure, comparing observations across time without adjusting for inflation may not yield meaningful results. This is because prices change over time due to factors such as inflation.
          - In order to enable comparisons across different time periods, it is necessary to consider the impact of price changes.
          - In the context of this indicator, where there is no breakdown of the destinations where tourists spend their money on travel activities, the data has been adjusted for inflation using the US Consumer Price Index (CPI).
        description_short: This data is expressed in constant US dollars. It is adjusted for inflation but does not account for differences in the cost of living between countries.

        description_short: This data is adjusted for inflation and differences in the cost of living between countries.
        description_processing: The purchasing power parity (PPP) and consumer price index (CPI) are used to adjust the expenditure data for inflation and purchasing power differences. This adjustment allows for a more accurate comparison of expenditure data across different years and countries.
        description_key:
          - *desc_key_exp
          - In the context of this specific indicator, adjustments have been made to account for inflation and differences in the cost of living in the destination countries where tourists spend their money.
          - To achieve this, the expenditure data has been converted from US dollars to the local currency of each respective country.
          - The inflation adjustment is based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the year 2021 specific to each country.
          - Finally, the data is expressed in international 2021 US dollars, enabling consistent and comparable analysis across different destinations and time periods.
          - Following the adjustment, in countries where the cost of living is lower, the adjusted total expenditure will reflect a higher value.
          - This indicates that tourist money holds greater purchasing power in terms of acquiring goods and services, allowing tourists to obtain more with their expenditures in these destinations.

       description_key:
        - The Tourism Satellite Account (TSA) and System of Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA) are standardized methods used by countries to measure the economic and environmental impacts of tourism.
        - TSA tables track economic aspects of tourism, such as tourist spending, the production of tourism-related goods and services, and employment in the tourism sector.
        - SEEA tables monitor environmental impacts, including the consumption of resources like water and energy, as well as the emission of greenhouse gases and generation of waste by the tourism industry.
        - National governments or statistical agencies collect and organize data into these tables to understand tourism's influence on the economy and environment.
        - The number of tables implemented indicates how comprehensively tourism's impacts are being tracked, with more tables providing a more detailed and nuanced understanding.

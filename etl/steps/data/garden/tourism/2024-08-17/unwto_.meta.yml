  desc_key_arrivals: &desc_key_arrivals
      - When an individual visits a country multiple times within a year, each visit is counted as a separate arrival.
      - Similarly, if a person travels to multiple countries during a single trip, their arrival in each country is recorded individually.
      - As a result, the number of arrivals does not necessarily reflect the number of individuals traveling, as one person can generate multiple arrivals.
      - Note that before 2006, the US counted same-day trips from Canada only. After 2006, day trips from Mexico were also included.
  descr_key_domestic: &descr_key_domestic
      -  A domestic tourism trip refers to the travel of a visitor from the time of leaving their usual residence until they return.
      -  When an individual travels domestically multiple times within a year, each journey is counted as a separate trip.
  descr_key_purpose: &descr_key_purpose
      - The main purpose of a trip is defined as the purpose in the absence of which the trip would not have taken place.
      - Visits for personal reasons include holidays, leisure, and recreation; visiting friends and relatives; education and training; health and medical care; religion/pilgrimages; shopping; transit; and other miscellaneous reasons.
  desc_key_departures: &desc_key_departures
      - Tourist departures data track the movement of locals who travel abroad and come back on the same day.
      - When an individual leaves its residence country multiple times within a year, each visit is counted as a separate departure.
      - As a result, the number of departures does not necessarily reflect the number of individuals traveling, as one person can generate multiple departures.
  desc_key_exp: &desc_key_exp
      - Expenditures associated with international visitors are traditionally categorized under the travel item of the Balance of Payments (BOP). For inbound tourism, these expenses are recorded as "credits" in the BOP and referred to as "travel receipts".
      - It's important to note that BOP estimates also include expenditures related to other types of travelers, such as long-term students, patients, border workers, and seasonal workers, which can be substantial in some countries.

          - The underlying premise behind this indicator is that the country linked to the arrival should correspond to the individual's country of residence.
          - However, it is worth noting that certain countries deviate from UNWTO recommendations and classify their nationals residing abroad as a distinct category, rather than considering them as residents of those countries.

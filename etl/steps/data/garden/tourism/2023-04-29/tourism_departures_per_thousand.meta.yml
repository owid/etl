          International outbound tourists are the number of departures that people make from their country of usual residence to
          any other country for any purpose other than a remunerated activity in the country visited. The data on outbound
          tourists refer to the number of departures, not to the number of people traveling. Thus a person who makes several
          trips from a country during a given period is counted each time as a new departure. This figure is given per 1000 people.

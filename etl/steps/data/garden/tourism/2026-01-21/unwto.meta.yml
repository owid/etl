  # REUSABLE DESCRIPTION KEY BLOCKS
  # =============================================================================

  # --- Counting methodology ---
  desc_counting: &desc_counting |-
    Each trip by the same person is counted separately.

  # --- Arrivals and departures ---
  desc_key_arrivals: &desc_key_arrivals
    - *desc_counting
    - When an individual visits a country multiple times within a year, each visit is counted as a separate arrival.
    - Similarly, if a person travels to multiple countries during a single trip, their arrival in each country is recorded individually.
    - As a result, the number of arrivals does not necessarily reflect the number of individuals traveling, as one person can generate multiple arrivals.

  desc_key_arrivals_us_note: &desc_key_arrivals_us_note
    - Before 2006, the US counted same-day trips from Canada only. After 2006, day trips from Mexico were also included.

  desc_key_departures: &desc_key_departures
    - When an individual leaves its residence country multiple times within a year, each visit is counted as a separate departure.
    - As a result, the number of departures does not necessarily reflect the number of individuals traveling, as one person can generate multiple departures.

  # --- Domestic tourism ---
  desc_key_domestic: &desc_key_domestic
    - A domestic trip refers to travel from the time of leaving one's usual residence until returning.
    - *desc_counting

  # --- Trip purpose ---
  desc_key_purpose: &desc_key_purpose
    - *desc_counting
    - The main purpose of a trip is defined as the purpose in the absence of which the trip would not have taken place.

  # --- Region of origin ---
  desc_key_region_origin: &desc_key_region_origin
    - The country linked to the departure should correspond to the visitor's country of residence.
    - However, some countries deviate from UN Tourism recommendations and classify their nationals residing abroad as a distinct category, rather than as residents of those countries.

  # --- Per capita metrics ---
  desc_key_per_1000_arrivals: &desc_key_per_1000_arrivals
    - Per "1,000 people" refers to the calculation of trips per 1,000 individuals within the population of the destination country.
    - This enables standardized comparison across different population sizes and provides an estimate of tourism intensity.
    - For instance, if there are "10 arrivals per 1,000 people," it means that among every 1,000 individuals in the population, there are 10 international arrivals.

  desc_key_per_1000_same_day: &desc_key_per_1000_same_day
    - Per "1,000 people" refers to the calculation of trips per 1,000 individuals within the population of the destination country.
    - This enables standardized comparison across different population sizes and provides insight into the level of same-day travel.
    - For instance, if there are "10 same-day arrivals per 1,000 people," it means that among every 1,000 individuals in the population, there are 10 international same-day arrivals.

  desc_key_per_1000_departures: &desc_key_per_1000_departures
    - Per "1,000 people" refers to the calculation of trips per 1,000 individuals within the population of the origin country.
    - This enables standardized comparison across different population sizes and provides an estimate of outbound tourism intensity.
    - For instance, if there are "10 departures per 1,000 people," it means that among every 1,000 individuals in the population, there are 10 international departures.

  desc_key_per_1000_employment: &desc_key_per_1000_employment
    - Per "1,000 people" refers to the calculation of employed persons per 1,000 individuals within the population.
    - This enables standardized comparison across different population sizes and provides an estimate of the significance of the tourism sector in terms of employment.
    - For instance, if there are "10 employed persons in the tourism industries per 1,000 people," it means that among every 1,000 individuals in the population, there are 10 persons employed in tourism-related jobs.

  # --- Employment ---
  desc_key_employment: &desc_key_employment
    - Includes employees and the self-employed.
    - Individuals may hold multiple jobs concurrently and could be counted in multiple tourism sectors.

  # =============================================================================
  # INBOUND TOURISM (Receipts) — Money flowing INTO a country from foreign visitors
  # =============================================================================

  desc_key_inbound_travel: &desc_key_inbound_travel
    - International tourism receipts (travel) measure the money a country earns from foreign visitors spending within its borders.
    - This covers accommodation, food and drink, local transport, entertainment, shopping, and cruise fares.
    - It excludes international transport to reach the destination (such as flights), which is recorded separately.
    - All types of foreign visitors are included, such as students and seasonal workers, which can be significant in certain countries.

  desc_key_inbound_passenger_transport: &desc_key_inbound_passenger_transport
    - International tourism receipts (passenger transport) measure the money a country earns when foreign visitors fly on its airlines.
    - For example, if a French tourist flies to Brazil on a Brazilian airline, that fare counts as a receipt for Brazil.
    - This includes airfares, excess baggage fees, and onboard purchases, but excludes cruise fares (counted under travel).

  desc_key_inbound_total: &desc_key_inbound_total
    - Total international tourism receipts measure all the money a country earns from foreign visitors.
    - This includes spending within the country (accommodation, food, transport, entertainment, shopping, cruises) plus fares paid to the country's airlines.
    - All types of foreign visitors are included, such as students and seasonal workers, which can be significant in certain countries.

  # =============================================================================
  # OUTBOUND TOURISM (Expenditure) — Money flowing OUT of a country when residents travel abroad
  # =============================================================================

  desc_key_outbound_travel: &desc_key_outbound_travel
    - International tourism expenditure (travel) measures the money a country's residents spend in foreign countries.
    - This covers accommodation, food and drink, local transport, entertainment, shopping, and cruise fares abroad, but not purchases made at home before the trip.
    - It excludes international transport (such as flights), which is recorded separately.

  desc_key_outbound_passenger_transport: &desc_key_outbound_passenger_transport
    - International tourism expenditure (passenger transport) measures the money a country's residents pay to foreign airlines.
    - For example, if a Brazilian flies to France on Air France, that fare counts as expenditure for Brazil. Flying on a Brazilian airline would not count here.
    - This includes airfares, excess baggage fees, and onboard purchases, but excludes cruise fares (counted under travel).

  desc_key_outbound_total: &desc_key_outbound_total
    - Total international tourism expenditure measures all the money a country's residents spend abroad as tourists.
    - This includes spending in foreign countries (accommodation, food, transport, entertainment, shopping, cruises) plus fares paid to foreign airlines.
    - All types of foreign visitors are included, such as students and seasonal workers, which can be significant in certain countries.

  # =============================================================================
  # INFLATION ADJUSTMENT NOTES
  # =============================================================================

  note_us_cpi_adjustment: &note_us_cpi_adjustment |-
    Values have been adjusted for US inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) with 2021 as the base year. CPI data comes from the World Bank World Development Indicators (FP.CPI.TOTL).

  note_ppp_cpi_adjustment: &note_ppp_cpi_adjustment |-
    Values have been adjusted for both local inflation and differences in cost of living across countries. Expenditures were converted from current US dollars to local currency using World Bank exchange rates, inflation-adjusted to a 2021 base year, and converted to international dollars using PPP factors. As UN Tourism does not report the exchange rates used to convert from local currency to nominal US dollars, our reliance on World Bank exchange rates may introduce uncertainty, especially where exchange rates are volatile.

          - A high percentage means that the country earns a large amount from foreign visitors relative to the size of the economy. A low percentage means inbound tourism spending makes up a smaller share of GDP.
          - In small countries with a lot of tourism, this ratio can look very large. This is because this indicator compares total international tourist spending to the overall size of the economy, [GDP](#dod:gdp). It is not the same as the tourism sector's contribution to GDP, which is shown in this other chart[https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/tourism-gdp-proportion-of-total-gdp].

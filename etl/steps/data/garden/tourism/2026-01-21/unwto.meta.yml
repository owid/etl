      - When an individual visits a country multiple times within a year, each visit is counted as a separate arrival.
      - Similarly, if a person travels to multiple countries during a single trip, their arrival in each country is recorded individually.
      - As a result, the number of arrivals does not necessarily reflect the number of individuals traveling, as one person can generate multiple arrivals.
      - Note that before 2006, the US counted same-day trips from Canada only. After 2006, day trips from Mexico were also included.

      - Expenditures associated with international visitors are traditionally categorized under the travel item of the Balance of Payments (BOP). For inbound tourism, these expenses are recorded as "credits" in the BOP and referred to as "travel receipts".
      - It's important to note that BOP estimates also include expenditures related to other types of travelers, such as long-term students, patients, border workers, and seasonal workers, which can be substantial in some countries.

          - SEEA tables monitor environmental impacts, including the consumption of resources like water and energy, as well as the emission of greenhouse gases and generation of waste by the tourism industry.
          - National governments or statistical agencies collect and organize data into these tables to understand tourism's influence on the economy and environment.
          - The number of tables implemented indicates how comprehensively tourism's impacts are being tracked, with more tables providing a more detailed and nuanced understanding.

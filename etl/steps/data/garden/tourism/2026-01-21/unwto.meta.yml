  desc_key_arrivals: &desc_key_arrivals
      - When an individual visits a country multiple times within a year, each visit is counted as a separate arrival.
      - Similarly, if a person travels to multiple countries during a single trip, their arrival in each country is recorded individually.
      - As a result, the number of arrivals does not necessarily reflect the number of individuals traveling, as one person can generate multiple arrivals.
      - Note that before 2006, the US counted same-day trips from Canada only. After 2006, day trips from Mexico were also included.
  descr_key_domestic: &descr_key_domestic
      -  A domestic trip refers to the travel of a visitor from the time of leaving their usual residence until they return.
      -  When an individual travels domestically multiple times within a year, each journey is counted as a separate trip.
  descr_key_purpose: &descr_key_purpose
      - The main purpose of a trip is defined as the purpose in the absence of which the trip would not have taken place.
  desc_key_departures: &desc_key_departures
      - When an individual leaves its residence country multiple times within a year, each visit is counted as a separate departure.
      - As a result, the number of departures does not necessarily reflect the number of individuals traveling, as one person can generate multiple departures.

  note_inflation_adjustment: &note_inflation_adjustment |-
      Values have been adjusted for US inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to account for changes in the purchasing power of the US dollar over time. This adjustment was made by deflating nominal expenditure values using the US CPI with 2021 as the base year. The CPI data comes from the World Bank World Development Indicators (FP.CPI.TOTL).

  note_ppp_cpi_adjustment: &note_ppp_cpi_adjustment |-
      Values have been adjusted for both local inflation and differences in cost of living across countries. First, expenditures were converted to local currency using official exchange rates. Second, local CPI was used to adjust for inflation with 2021 as the base year. Finally, PPP conversion factors for private consumption were applied to convert to internationally comparable dollars. This dual adjustment allows for meaningful comparisons both across countries and over time. Data sources include UNWTO for tourism expenditure and World Bank World Development Indicators for CPI, exchange rates, and PPP conversion factors.

  # INBOUND TOURISM (Receipts) — Money flowing INTO a country from foreign visitors
  # =============================================================================

  desc_key_inbound_travel: &desc_key_inbound_travel
    - International tourism receipts (travel) measure the money a country earns from foreign visitors spending within its borders.
    - This covers accommodation, food and drink, local transport, entertainment, shopping, and cruise fares.
    - It excludes international transport to reach the destination (such as flights), which is recorded separately.
    - Transactions associated with all types of foreign visitors considered, including students or seasonal workers, which can be significant in certain countries.

  desc_key_inbound_passenger_transport: &desc_key_inbound_passenger_transport
    - International tourism receipts (passenger transport) measure the money a country earns when foreign visitors fly on its airlines.
    - For example, if a French tourist flies to Brazil on a Brazilian airline, that fare counts as a receipt for Brazil.
    - This includes airfares, excess baggage fees, and onboard purchases — but excludes cruise fares, which are counted under travel.

  desc_key_inbound_total: &desc_key_inbound_total
    - Total international tourism receipts measure all the money a country earns from foreign visitors.
    - This includes what visitors spend within the country (accommodation, food, transport, entertainment, shopping, cruises) plus what they pay the country's airlines to get there.
    - These receipts represent an important source of foreign currency earnings for many economies.
    - Transactions associated with all types of foreign visitors considered, including students or seasonal workers, which can be significant in certain countries.

  # OUTBOUND TOURISM (Expenditure) — Money flowing OUT of a country when residents travel abroad
  # =============================================================================

  desc_key_outbound_travel: &desc_key_outbound_travel
    - International tourism expenditure (travel) measures the money a country's residents spend in foreign countries.
    - This covers accommodation, food and drink, local transport, entertainment, shopping, and cruise fares abroad — but not purchases made at home before the trip.
    - It excludes international transport (such as flights), which is recorded separately.

  desc_key_outbound_passenger_transport: &desc_key_outbound_passenger_transport
    - International tourism expenditure (passenger transport) measures the money a country's residents pay to foreign airlines.
    - For example, if a Brazilian flies to France on Air France, that fare counts as expenditure for Brazil. Flying on a Brazilian airline would not count here.
    - This includes airfares, excess baggage fees, and onboard purchases — but excludes cruise fares, which are counted under travel.

  desc_key_outbound_total: &desc_key_outbound_total
    - Total international tourism expenditure measures all the money a country's residents spend abroad as tourists.
    - This includes what they spend in foreign countries (accommodation, food, transport, entertainment, shopping, cruises) plus what they pay foreign airlines.
    - A country with high outbound expenditure relative to inbound receipts has a tourism trade deficit — more money leaving than entering through tourism.

First, we converted expenditures from US dollars to local currency using official exchange rates. Then we adjusted for local inflation using each country's Consumer Price Index (CPI), normalized to 2021. Finally, we converted the values to international dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factors for private consumption from 2021.

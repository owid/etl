          When an individual visits a country multiple times within a year, each visit is counted as a separate arrival. Similarly, if a person travels to multiple countries during a single trip, their arrival in each country is recorded individually. As a result, the number of arrivals does not necessarily reflect the number of individuals traveling, as one person can generate multiple arrivals.


          Tourist arrivals data pertain to international visitors entering the economic territory of the referenced country and include visits by people who stay overnight. These data can be obtained from various sources, including administrative records such as police, immigration, and traffic controls, as well as border surveys and registrations at accommodation establishments.

        unit: international dollars
        short_unit: $
        description: >
          In the context of this specific indicator, adjustments have been made to account for inflation and differences in the cost of living in the destination countries where tourists spend their money. To achieve this, the expenditure data has been converted from US dollars to the local currency of each respective country. The inflation adjustment is based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the year 2021 specific to each country. Finally, the data is expressed in international 2021 US dollars, enabling consistent and comparable analysis across different destinations and time periods. Following the adjustment, in countries where the cost of living is lower, the adjusted total expenditure will reflect a higher value. This indicates that tourist money holds greater purchasing power in terms of acquiring goods and services, allowing tourists to obtain more with their expenditures in these destinations.

          Expenditures associated with international visitors are traditionally categorized under the travel item of the Balance of Payments (BOP). For inbound tourism, these expenses are recorded as "credits" in the BOP and referred to as "travel receipts". It's important to note that BOP estimates also include expenditures related to other types of travelers, such as long-term students, patients, border workers, and seasonal workers, which can be substantial in some countries.

        description: >
          When reporting a time series of expenditure, comparing observations across time without adjusting for inflation may not yield meaningful results. This is because prices change over time due to factors such as inflation. In order to enable comparisons across different time periods, it is necessary to consider the impact of price changes. In the context of this indicator, where there is no breakdown of the destinations where tourists spend their money on travel activities, the data has been adjusted for inflation using the US Consumer Price Index (CPI).

          Expenditures associated with international visitors are traditionally categorized under the travel item of the Balance of Payments (BOP).

    This dataset provides information on armed conflicts, using data from Peter Brecke's Conflict Catalog.

    The data includes information on the number of ongoing and new conflicts, the number of ongoing and new conflict types, as well as the number of deaths in ongoing conflicts and conflict types.

    Deaths of combatants and civilians due to fighting, disease, and starvation are included.

    We change the world regions in the data: Africa (from East & South Africa, North Africa, and West & Central Africa), Americas (from North America, Central America, and the Carribean and South America), Asia (from Central Asia, East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia), Europe (from Eastern Europe and Western Europe),  and Middle East (from Arabian Peninsula and Iran west to Syria).

    You can find more information about the data in our article:

          The estimated number of deaths in all ongoing armed conflicts in each year. This includes interstate and internal conflicts.

          An ongoing armed conflict is a disagreement between organized groups, or between an organized group and civilians, that causes at least 32 deaths during a year.

          Deaths of combatants and civilians due to fighting, disease, and starvation are included.

          For conflicts without any deaths estimate, we conversatively coded the Conflict Catalog's lower bound for including a conflict, 32 deaths each year.
          <% elif conflict_type == "interstate" %>
          The estimated number of deaths in ongoing interstate conflicts in each year.

          An ongoing interstate conflict is a conflict between states that causes at least 32 deaths during a year.

          We identify interstate conflicts in the Conflict Catalog using the approach by Seshat (while correcting any mistakes for the 200 deadliest conflicts): https://seshatdatabank.info/cleaning-history-data-the-conflict-catalogue/

          An ongoing internal conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed groups, between non-state armed groups, or between an armed group and civilians, that causes at least 32 deaths during a year.

          We count a conflict as ongoing in a region even if the conflict is also ongoing in other regions. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing conflicts.

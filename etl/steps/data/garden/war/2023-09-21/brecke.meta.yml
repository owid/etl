      An ongoing armed conflict is a disagreement between organized groups, or between an organized group and civilians, that causes at least 32 deaths during a year.

      An ongoing interstate conflict is a conflict between states that causes at least 32 deaths during a year.
      <% elif conflict_type == "internal" %>
      An ongoing internal conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed groups, between non-state armed groups, or between an armed group and civilians, that causes at least 32 deaths during a year.

dataset:
  title: History of war (Brecke, 1999)
  description: |-
    This dataset provides information on armed conflicts, using data from Peter Brecke's Conflict Catalog.

    The data includes information on the number of ongoing and new conflicts, the number of ongoing and new conflict types, as well as the number of deaths in ongoing conflicts and conflict types.

    Deaths of combatants and civilians due to fighting, disease, and starvation are included.

    We change the world regions in the data. The list belows lists these, along with the codes of the countries in them. Find the complete list of country codes at https://correlatesofwar.org/wp-content/uploads/states2016.csv.

    - Africa (from East & South Africa, North Africa, and West & Central Africa): 402-626
    - Americas (from North America, Central America, and the Caribbean and South America): 2-165
    - Asia and Oceania (from Central Asia, East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia): 700-990
    - Europe (from Eastern Europe and Western Europe): 200-395, 640
    - Middle East (from Arabian Peninsula and Iran west to Syria): 630, 645-698

    You can find more information about the data in our article: [To be published]

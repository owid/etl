dataset:
  title: History of war (COW, 2020)
  description: |-
    This dataset provides information on wars, using data from Correlates of War's Inter-State War Data (version 4.0), Intra-State War Data (version 5.1), Extra-State War Data (version 4.0), and Non-State War Data (version 4.0).

    We combine these datasets to provide information on the number of ongoing and new wars, the number of ongoing and new war types, as well as the number of deaths in ongoing wars and war types.

    Deaths of combatants due to fighting, disease, and starvation are included.

    We align the world regions across the datasets to be Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Oceania. This meant we sometimes had to identify the regions manually. The regions are defined based on Gleditsch and Ward codes. Find the complete mapping at
    https://correlatesofwar.org/wp-content/uploads/states2016.csv

      • Americas: 2-165

      • Europe: 200-399

      • Africa: 402-626

      • Middle East: 630-698

      • Asia and Oceania: 700-999

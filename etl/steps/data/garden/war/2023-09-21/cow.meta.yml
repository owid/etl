      A war is a conflict between armed groups that causes at least 1,000 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "state-based" -%>
      A state-based war is a conflict between two armed groups, at least one of which is a state, that causes at least 1,000 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "inter-state" -%>
      An interstate war is a conflict between states that causes at least 1,000 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "intra-state" -%>
      An intrastate war is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group, or between non-state armed groups, that causes at least 1,000 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}. If a foreign state is involved, it is called "internationalized", and "non-internationalized" otherwise.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "intra-state (internationalized)" -%>
      An internationalized intrastate war is a conflict between a foreign state and a non-state armed group, or between non-state armed groups, that causes at least 1,000 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "intra-state (non-internationalized)" -%>
      An non-internationalized intrastate war is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group, or between non-state armed groups, that causes at least 1,000 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "extra-state" -%>
      An extrastate war is a conflict between a state and a non-state region it seeks to control, or between a state and a colony that seeks policy change or independence, that causes at least 1,000 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "non-state conflict" -%>
      A non-state war is a conflict between non-state armed groups within a region without a state or across state borders, that causes at least 1,000 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

dataset:
  title: History of war (COW, 2020)
  description: |-
    This dataset provides information on wars, using data from Correlates of War's Inter-State War Data (version 4.0), Intra-State War Data (version 5.1), Extra-State War Data (version 4.0), and Non-State War Data (version 4.0).

    We combine these datasets to provide information on the number of ongoing and new wars, the number of ongoing and new war types, as well as the number of deaths in ongoing wars and war types.

    Deaths of combatants due to fighting, disease, and starvation are included.

    We align the world regions across the datasets to be Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Oceania. This meant we sometimes had to identify the regions manually. The regions are defined based on Gleditsch and Ward codes. Find the complete mapping at
    https://correlatesofwar.org/wp-content/uploads/states2016.csv

      • Americas: 2-165

      • Europe: 200-399

      • Africa: 402-626

      • Middle East: 630-698

      • Asia and Oceania: 700-999

    You can find more information about the data in our article: [To be published]

      <%- if conflict_type == "all" -%>
      An armed conflict is a disagreement between organized groups, or between one organized group and civilians, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "state-based" -%>
      A state-based conflict is a conflict between two armed groups, at least one of which is a state, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "interstate" -%>
      An interstate conflict is a conflict between states that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "intrastate" -%>
      An intrastate conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}. If a foreign state is involved, it is called "internationalized", and "non-internationalized" otherwise.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "intrastate (internationalized)" -%>
      An internationalized intrastate conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group, with involvement of a foreign state, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "intrastate (non-internationalized)" -%>
      An non-internationalized intrastate conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group, without involvement of a foreign state, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "extrasystemic" -%>
      An extrasystemic conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group outside its territory that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "non-state conflict" -%>
      A non-state conflict is a conflict between non-state armed groups, such as rebel groups, criminal organizations, or ethnic groups, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "one-sided violence" -%>
      One-sided violence is the use of armed force by a state or non-state armed group against civilians that causes at least 25 civilian deaths during a year.

dataset:
  title: History of war (PRIO v3.1, 2017)
  description: |-
    This dataset provides information on armed conflicts, using data from the PRIO Battledeaths Dataset (version 3.1).

    We combine these datasets to provide information on the number of ongoing and new conflicts, the number of ongoing and new conflict types, as well as the number of deaths in ongoing conflicts and conflict types.

    Deaths of combatants and civilians due to fighting are included.

    We use the world regions as defined by PRIO: Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Middle East. The regions are defined based on Gleditsch and Ward codes, as in "UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset".
    Find the complete mapping at http://ksgleditsch.com/data/iisystem.dat (states) and http://ksgleditsch.com/data/microstatessystem.dat (micro-states).

      • Americas: 2-199

      • Europe: 200-399

      • Africa: 400-626

      • Middle East: 630-699

      • Asia and Oceania: 700-999

    You can find more information about the data in our article: [To be published]

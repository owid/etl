      An interstate conflict is a disagreement between states where force is threatened, displayed, or used.
    force_usage: &force_usage |-
      A threat of force can be unspecified, or entail threatening to declare war or to occupy territory; a display of force can entail shows of force or border violations; a use of force can entail attacks, clashes, or battles.

      Included are conflicts between states where force was threatened, displayed, used, or escalated to a war that year

      Included are conflicts between states with no reported deaths that year

      Included are conflicts between states in which more than 1,000 deaths were reported that year

      <%- elif hostility == "Threat to use force" -%>
      Included are conflicts between states where, at most, use of force was threatened that year

      Included are conflicts between states where, at most, force was displayed that year

      <%- elif hostility == "Use of force" -%>
      Included are conflicts between states where, at most, force was used that year, but there were fewer than 1,000 combatant deaths

      Included are interstate wars that were ongoing that year

      - We count a conflict as ongoing in a region even if the conflict is also ongoing in other regions. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing conflict.
      - The hostility level for a conflict overall is the highest level across all world regions.
      - Deaths of combatants due to fighting are included.

  number_new_disputes:

      <%- if hostility == "Use of force" -%>
      Included are conflicts between states where, at most, force was used that year for the first time, but there were fewer than 1,000 combatant deaths.

      Included are interstate wars that started that year.

    description_key: &description_key_new
      - *interstate_conflict
      - *force_usage
      - We only count a conflict as new when the conflict overall started that year, not if it restarted or changed its hostility level (i.e. escalated or deescalated).
      - We count a conflict as new in a region even if the conflict started at the same time in another region. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of new conflicts.
      - The hostility level for a conflict overall is the highest level across all world regions.

  # MAIN INDICATORS
  cow_mid:
    description: >-
      Data on the number of disputes and deaths from militarized disputes.

      A militarized dispute (MID) is based on a sequence of related militarized incidents, each of which (except the first)
      is an outgrowth of or a response to one or more previous incidents. To ensure that each MID is a unified and recognized
      episode of militarized incidents, particular attention should be given to continuity of location and issue, as well as
      the interpretations of observers.

dataset:
  title: History of war (COW MID, 2020)
  description: |-
      This dataset provides information on militarized interstate disputes, using Correlates of War's Militarized Interstate Disputes dataset (version 5.0).

      The dataset provides information on the number of ongoing and new interstate conflicts and the number of deaths in ongoing interstate conflicts.

      Deaths of combatants due to fighting are included.

      We use the world regions of the participants to code the conflicts' world region(s). The regions are defined based on Gleditsch and Ward codes. Find the complete mapping at
      https://correlatesofwar.org/wp-content/uploads/states2016.csv:

        • Americas: 2-165

        • Europe: 200-395

        • Africa: 402-626

        • Middle East: 630-698

        • Asia and Oceania: 700-999

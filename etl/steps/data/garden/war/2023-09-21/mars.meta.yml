      A conventional war is a conflict between combatants with differentiated militaries and clear frontlines that causes at least 500 deaths over its duration.

      A conventional interstate war is a conflict between states with differentiated militaries and clear frontlines that causes at least 500 deaths over its duration.

      A civil war is a conflict between combatants that were previously part of the same state, but now at least one seeks control or secession. It is fought with differentiated militaries and clear frontlines and causes at least 500 deaths over its duration.

dataset:
  title: History of war (Project Mars, 2020)
  description: |-
    This dataset provides information on conventional wars, using data from Jason Lyall's Project Mars.

    The project provides information on the number of ongoing and new wars, the number of ongoing and new war types, as well as the number of deaths in ongoing wars and war types.

    Deaths of combatants due to fighting are included.

    We use the world regions as defined by Project Mars. The regions are shown below, along with the codes of the countries in them. Find the complete list of country codes at https://correlatesofwar.org/wp-content/uploads/states2016.csv.

    - Americas: 2-165
    - Europe: 200-395
    - Sub-Saharan Africa: 402-420, 433-434, 437-482, 484-517, 540-591
    - North Africa and the Middle East: 432, 435-436, 483, 520-531, 600-698
    - Asia and Oceania: 700-990

    You can find more information about the data in our article: [To be published]

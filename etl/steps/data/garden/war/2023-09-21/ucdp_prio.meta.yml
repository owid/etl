      An armed conflict is a disagreement between organized groups, or between one organized group and civilians, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "state-based" -%>
      A state-based conflict is a conflict between two armed groups, at least one of which is a state, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      An intrastate conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}. If a foreign state is involved, it is called "internationalized", and "non-internationalized" otherwise.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "intrastate (internationalized)" -%>
      An internationalized intrastate conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group, with involvement of a foreign state, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "intrastate (non-internationalized)" -%>
      An non-internationalized intrastate conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group, without involvement of a foreign state, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "extrasystemic" -%>
      An extrasystemic conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group outside its territory that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "non-state conflict" -%>
      A non-state conflict is a conflict between non-state armed groups, such as rebel groups, criminal organizations, or ethnic groups, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "one-sided violence" -%>
      One-sided violence is the use of armed force by a state or non-state armed group against civilians that causes at least 25 civilian deaths during a year.

      Data prior to 1989 is sourced from PRIO. Data since 1989 is sourced from UCDP.

      For conflict years without a best deaths estimate in the PRIO data, we conservatively coded the low estimate.

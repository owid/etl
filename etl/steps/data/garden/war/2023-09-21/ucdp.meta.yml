      An intrastate conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year.
      <%- elif conflict_type == "intrastate (internationalized)" -%>
      An internationalized intrastate conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group, with involvement of a foreign state, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year.
      <%- elif conflict_type == "intrastate (non-internationalized)" -%>
      A non-internationalized intrastate conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group, without involvement of a foreign state, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year.

      A non-state conflict is a conflict between non-state armed groups that causes at least 25 deaths during a year.
      <%- elif conflict_type == "one-sided violence" -%>
      One-sided violence is the use of armed force by a state or non-state armed group against civilians that causes at least 25 deaths during a year.
      <%- elif conflict_type == "state-based" -%>
      A state-based conflict is a conflict between two armed groups, at least one of which is a state, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year.

    location_conflicts_method: |-
      UCDP provides geo coordinates of each conflict event. We have mapped this coordinates to countries by means of the Natural Earth dataset.

      In some instances, the event's coordinates fall within the borders of a country. Other times, the event's coordinates fall outside the borders of a country. In the latter case, we have mapped the event to the country that is closest to the event's coordinates.

      Conflict event with id "53238" and relid "PAK-2003-1-345-88" was assigned to "Siachen Glacier" by Natural Earth. We have mapped it to "Pakistan" following the text in the where_description field in the source data. This says "Giang sector in Siachen, Pakistani Kashmir".

dataset:
  title: History of war (UCDP, 2023)
  description: |-
    This dataset provides information on armed conflicts, using data from the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (version 23.1), the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset (version 23.1), and the UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset (version 23.1).

    We aggregate the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset up to the year and world (region) to identify all conflict deaths, non-state conflicts, and one-sided violence.

    We use the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset to identify state-based conflicts: interstate, intrastate (all, internationalized, and non-internationalized), and extrasystemic.

    We use the UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset to link deaths in the Georeferenced Event Dataset to types of state-based conflicts in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset.

    We combine these datasets to provide information on the number of ongoing and new conflicts, the number of ongoing and new conflict types, as well as the number of deaths in ongoing conflicts and conflict types.

    Deaths of combatants and civilians due to fighting are included.

    The Georeferenced Event Dataset has been extracted from the UCDP systems at a certain point in time. However, the UCDP team works with the data all year round, including revisions and updates. Therefore, their dashboard
    might show slightly more up-to-date data, which sometimes result in minor discrepancies in the data.

    We use the world regions as defined by UCDP/PRIO: Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Middle East. These are defined based on Gleditsch and Ward codes. Find the complete mapping at
    http://ksgleditsch.com/data/iisystem.dat (states) and http://ksgleditsch.com/data/microstatessystem.dat (micro-states):

      • Americas: 2-199

      • Europe: 200-399

      • Africa: 400-626

      • Middle East: 630-699

      • Asia and Oceania: 700-999

    You can find more information about the data in our article: [To be published]

    This dataset contains information on armed conflicts - state, non-state and one-sided conflicts, in the period of 1989 and 2022.

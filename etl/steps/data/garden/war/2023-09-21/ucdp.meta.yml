dataset:
  title: History of war (UCDP, 2023)
  description: |-
    This dataset provides information on armed conflicts, using data from the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (version 23.1), the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset (version 23.1), and the UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset (version 23.1).

    We aggregate the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset up to the year and world (region) to identify all conflict deaths, non-state conflicts, and one-sided violence.

    We use the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset to identify state-based conflicts: interstate, intrastate (all, internationalized, and non-internationalized), and extrasystemic.

    We use the UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset to link deaths in the Georeferenced Event Dataset to types of state-based conflicts in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset.

    We combine these datasets to provide information on the number of ongoing and new conflicts, the number of ongoing and new conflict types, as well as the number of deaths in ongoing conflicts and conflict types.

    Deaths of combatants and civilians due to fighting are included.

    The Georeferenced Event Dataset has been extracted from the UCDP systems at a certain point in time. However, the UCDP team works with the data all year round, including revisions and updates. Therefore, their dashboard
    might show slightly more up-to-date data, which sometimes result in minor discrepancies in the data.

    We use the world regions as defined by UCDP/PRIO: Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Middle East. These are defined based on Gleditsch and Ward codes. Find the complete mapping at
    http://ksgleditsch.com/data/iisystem.dat (states) and http://ksgleditsch.com/data/microstatessystem.dat (micro-states):

      • Americas: 2-199

      • Europe: 200-399

      • Africa: 400-626

      • Middle East: 630-699

      • Asia and Oceania: 700-999

    You can find more information about the data in our article: [To be published]

    This dataset contains information on armed conflicts - state, non-state and one-sided conflicts, in the period of 1989 and 2022.

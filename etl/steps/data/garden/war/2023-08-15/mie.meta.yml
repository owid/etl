  title: History of war (Gibler and Miller, 2020)
  description: |-
      This dataset provides information on militarized interstate confrontations, using Douglas Gibler and Steven Miller's Militarized Interstate Events dataset (version 1.0).

      The dataset provides information on the number of ongoing and new interstate conflicts and the number of deaths in ongoing interstate conflicts.

      Deaths of combatants due to fighting are included.

      We use the world regions of the participants to code the conflicts' world region(s). The regions are defined based on Gleditsch and Ward codes. Find the complete mapping at

        • Americas: 2-165

        • Europe: 200-395

        • Africa: 402-626

        • Middle East: 630-698

        • Asia: 700-850

          An interstate conflict is a disagreement between states where force is threatened, displayed, or used.

          We count a conflict as ongoing in a region even if the conflict is also ongoing in other regions. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing conflicts.
          <% elif hostility_level == "Threat to use force" %>
          The number of interstate conflicts where at most the use of force is threatened in each year.

          The number of all new interstate conflicts in each year.

          A new interstate conflict is a disagreement between states where force is threatened, displayed, or used for the first time.

          We only count a conflict as new when the conflict overall started that year, not if it restarted or changed its hostility level (i.e. escalated or deescalated).

          We count a conflict as new in a region even if the conflict started earlier or at the same time in another region. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of new conflicts.

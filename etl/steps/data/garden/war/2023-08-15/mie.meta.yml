      This dataset contains information on interstate conflicts in the period of 1816 and 2014.


      It has been constructed using the Militarized Interstate Events (MIE) Dataset (version 1) by D. M. Gibler and S. V. Miller.

      Regions: The regions are defined based on Gleditsch and Ward codes (GWno). Find complete mapping at

          We count a conflict as ongoing in a region even if the conflict is also ongoing in other regions.
          The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing conflicts.


          The same conflict can have different "hostility level" for different regions. When this is the case, we classify its global
          hostility level as the most hostile level based on the following rank (from less to most hostile):


            1: No militarized action

            2: Threat to use force

            3: Display of force

            4: Use of force

            5: War

        unit: conflicts
        description: >-
          Number of new disputes in a given year.


          • New disputes for the 'World': We only count a dispute as new when the dispute overall started that year, not if it restarted
          or its hostility level changed.

          • New disputes for all regions (except 'World'): We count a dispute as new in a region even if the dispute overall started
          earlier in another region. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of new disputes.

          • New disputes by hostility level: We only count a dispute as new when the dispute overall started that year, not if it changed
          its hostility level.


          Consequently, the number of new conflicts globally might be lower than the sum across all regions. This can be due to multiple reasons:
          (i) the same conflict occurs in multiple regions or (ii) a conflict starting in a region, but it already started earlier globally
          (in another region).


          The same conflict can have different "hostility level" for different regions. When this is the case, we classify its global
          hostility level as the most hostile level based on the following rank (from less to most hostile):


            1: No militarized action

            2: Threat to use force

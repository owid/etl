          The number of battle fatalities in a year over the course of wars.

          For some conflicts, data on the number of battle deaths is missing. In such cases, we have used the lower estimate as
          a lower bound.

          We count a war as ongoing in a region even if the conflict is also ongoing in other regions.
          The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing wars.

          • New conflicts for the 'World': We only count a war as new when the war overall started that year, not if it restarted
          or a new campaign within it begins.

          • New conflicts by type: We only consider the type of a conflict when it first started. Therefore, if a conflict transitions
          into a different type, we do not add one to the counter of new conflicts of this particular new type.

  # delivery_platform: |-
  #   A delivery platform refers to the system used to transport and deliver at least one nuclear weapon to its intended target. They can be land-based, sea-based, or air-based.
  # strategic_nuclear_mission: |-
  #   Strategic nuclear missions include:
  #   - Counter-value nuclear attacks, which aim at civilian targets such as population centers and major industrial complexes.
  #   - Counter-force attacks, which aim at military targets such as an adversary's nuclear delivery platforms and command-and-control centers.
  # delivery_platform_uses: |-
  #   Some delivery platforms can be used solely for strategic nuclear missions, while others can be used for both strategic and battlefield nuclear missions.
  # only_deployed_platforms: |-
  #   This data contains information about strategic nuclear delivery platforms that have been deployed. Platforms that were tested but never deployed are not considered.
  # yield: |-
  #   The yield of a nuclear strike is measured in equivalent megatonnage (EMT). This is the destructive capability of all strategic nuclear warheads of one state that can be delivered to another state.
  data_includes_all_states: |-
    This data includes all nuclear-armed states from 1945 to 2010.
  data_includes_strategic_warheads: |-
    The warheads included here are strategic ones — those designed for use away from the battlefield, such as against military bases, arms industries, or infrastructure.
  data_includes_deployable_strategic_warheads: |-
    Only those strategic warheads are included that could be deployed — those that could be carried by ballistic missiles, bombers, and submarines in one strike.
  number_of_warheads_uncertain: |-
    The exact number of countries' warheads is secret, and the estimates are based on publicly available information, historical records, and experts' estimates.
  world_area: |-
    For reference, the world's current total urban land area is around 1.9 million square kilometers.
  megaton: |-
    A "megaton" is the explosive energy released by one million tons of TNT. For comparison, the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 0.015 and 0.021 megatons, respectively.
  equivalent_megaton: |-
    An equivalent megaton is a way of making the explosive energy of different warheads comparable. It weighs small warheads — in this case those with at most one megaton — more than large ones, because they are relatively more destructive.
  area_destroyed: |-
    This data refers to the destruction of unprotected structures, such as building and factories.
  area_destroyed_calculation: |-
    We calculate the destroyable area by multiplying the equivalent megatonnage of all warheads with the approximate area destroyed by one megaton (20 square miles) and then converting it into square kilometers.

          - The area that can be destroyed by nuclear weapons of a certain yield is calculated based on Richelson, Jeffrey. 1980. Evaluating the Strategic Balance. American Journal of Political Science 24(4): 782. We assume each equivalent megaton can destroy 20 square miles, which is equivalent to 51.8 square kilometers.

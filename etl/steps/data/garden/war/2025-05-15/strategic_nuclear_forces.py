# totalw2 - This indicates the total number of nuclear warheads possessed by state B in a given year.
# NOTE: In the codebook, the definitions of totaldw1 and totaldw2 are identical. I fixed the following as expected:
# totaldw2 - This indicates the total number of nuclear warheads that can be delivered to state A by state B’s all strategic nuclear delivery platforms whose range of operation is greater than the A-B inter-capital distance in a given non-directed dyad year.

    # * The total number of nuclear warheads owned (the stockpile).

    # * The maximum yield (in number of megatons) that could be released on a first strike, against any country.

    # B (against country 200).

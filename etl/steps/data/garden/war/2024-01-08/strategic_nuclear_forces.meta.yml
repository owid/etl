    processing_level: major
  number_of_warheads_uncertain: |-
    The exact number of countries' warheads is secret, and the estimates are based on publicly available information, historical records, and experts' estimates.
  delivery_platform: |-
    A delivery platform refers to the system used to transport and deliver at least one nuclear weapon to its intended target. They can be land-based, sea-based, or air-based.
  strategic_nuclear_mission: |-
    Strategic nuclear missions include:
    - Counter-value nuclear attacks, which aim at civilian targets such as population centers and major industrial complexes.
    - Counter-force attacks, which aim at military targets such as an adversary's nuclear delivery platforms and command-and-control centers.
  delivery_platform_uses: |-
    Some delivery platforms can be used solely for strategic nuclear missions, while others can be used for both strategic and battlefield nuclear missions.
  data_includes_all_states: |-
    This data includes all nuclear-armed states from 1945 to 2010.
  only_deployed_platforms: |-
    This data contains information about strategic nuclear delivery platforms that have been deployed. Platforms that were tested but never deployed are not considered.
  world_area: |-
    For reference, the world's current total urban land area is around 1.9 million square kilometers.
  megaton: |-
    A "megaton" is the explosive energy released by one million tons of TNT. For comparison, the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 0.015 and 0.021 megatons, respectively.
  equivalent_megaton: |-
    An "equivalent megaton" is a term used to compare the overall destructive capability of multiple nuclear weapons with different yields. It is not just a sum of their individual yields. Instead, it considers how the combined non-linear effects of multiple smaller explosions compare to the effect of a single, larger explosion.
  yield: |-
    The yield of a nuclear strike is measured in equivalent megatonnage (EMT). This is the destructive capability of all strategic nuclear warheads of one state that can be delivered to another state.

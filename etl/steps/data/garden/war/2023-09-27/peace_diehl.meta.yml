      The peace scale level of a relationship for a given year reports the level as of the 31st of December of that year.

      Regions are defined based on their COW (Correlates of War) codes:

      • Americas: 2-165
      • Europe: 200-399
      • Africa: 402-626
      • Middle East: 630-698
      • Asia and Oceania: 700-999

      Fixes: The source used country codes 936 and 937 instead of 946 (Kiribati) and 947 (Tuvalu), respectively.

  description: |-
    This dataset provides information on the relationships between countries, using data from Diehl et al. (2023).

    We aggregate the data to the year and world (region).

    The data distinguishes five types of relationships between a pair of countries: severe rivalry, lesser rivalry, negative peace, warm peace, and security community.

    It does not include country pairs without any relationship.

          - We estimate the number of country-pairs with no relationship by subtracting the number of country-pairs with a relationship from the total number of country-pairs in the world. To estimate the total number of country-pairs in the world for a given year, we consider countries that appear in the dataset with a certain relationship.

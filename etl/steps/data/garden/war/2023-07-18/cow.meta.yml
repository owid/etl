    This dataset provides information on wars, using data from Correlates of War's Inter-State War Data (version 4.0), Intra-State War Data (version 5.1), Extra-State War Data (version 4.0), and Non-State War Data (version 4.0).

    We combine these datasets to provide information on the number of ongoing and new wars, the number of ongoing and new war types, as well as the number of deaths in ongoing wars and war types.

    Deaths of combatants due to fighting, disease, and starvation are included.

    We align the world regions across the datasets to be Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Oceania. This meant we sometimes had to identify the regions manually.

    You can find more information about the data in our article:

          The estimated number of deaths in all ongoing wars in each year. This includes interstate, intrastate, extrastate, and non-state wars.

          An ongoing interstate war is a conflict between states that causes at least 1,000 deaths during a year.

          Deaths of combatants due to fighting, disease, and starvation are included.

          If a war lasted more than one year, we distributed its deaths evenly across years. If a war was ongoing in more than one world region, we distributed its deaths across the regions of the participants.

          For wars without any deaths estimate, we conversatively coded Correlates of War's lower bound for including a war, 1,000 deaths each year.
          <% elif conflict_type == "inter-state" %>

          An ongoing war is a conflict between organized armed groups that causes at least 1,000 deaths during a year.

          We count a war as ongoing in a region even if the conflict is also ongoing in other regions. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing wars.

          We extend the time-series to 2007, by drawing on Correlates of War's Directed Dyadic Interstate War Dataset (version 4.01), which identifies no interstate wars for the years since 2003.

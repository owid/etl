      A conflict involving a state is defined by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) as a conflict between two armed groups, at least one of which is a state, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      A foreign-backed civil conflict is defined by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) as a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year, and at least one foreign state is involved in a supporting role. A non-state armed group can be a rebel group, criminal organization, or ethnic group. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      A domestic civil conflict is defined by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) as a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year, and no foreign state is involved in a supporting role. A non-state armed group can be a rebel group, criminal organization, or ethnic group. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      A colonial conflict is defined by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) as a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year, and takes place outside of the state's territory. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      A non-state conflict is defined by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) as a conflict between non-state armed groups, such as rebel groups, criminal organizations, or ethnic groups, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      One-sided violence is defined by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) as the use of armed force by a state or non-state armed group against civilians that causes at least 25 civilian deaths during a year.

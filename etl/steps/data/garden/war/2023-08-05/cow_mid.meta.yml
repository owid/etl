  title: History of war (COW MID, 2020)
  description: |-
      This dataset provides information on militarized interstate disputes, using Correlates of War's Militarized Interstate Disputes dataset (version 5.0).

      The dataset provides information on the number of ongoing and new interstate conflicts and the number of deaths in ongoing interstate conflicts.

      Deaths of combatants due to fighting are included.

      We use the world regions of the participants to code the conflicts' world region(s). The regions are defined based on Gleditsch and Ward codes. Find the complete mapping at
      https://correlatesofwar.org/wp-content/uploads/states2016.csv:

        • Americas: 2-165

        • Europe: 200-395

        • Africa: 402-626

        • Middle East: 630-698

        • Asia: 700-850

        • Oceania: 860-999

      Data on the number of disputes and deaths from militarized disputes.


      A militarized dispute (MID) is based on a sequence of related militarized incidents, each of which (except the first)
      is an outgrowth of or a response to one or more previous incidents. To ensure that each MID is a unified and recognized
      episode of militarized incidents, particular attention should be given to continuity of location and issue, as well as
      the interpretations of observers.

          An interstate conflict is a disagreement between states where force is threatened, displayed, or used.

          We count a conflict as ongoing in a region even if the conflict is also ongoing in other regions. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing conflict.
          <% elif hostility == "Threat to use force" %>
          The number of interstate conflicts in each year where at most the use of force is threatened over the conflict's duration.

          A new interstate conflict is a disagreement between states where force is threatened, displayed, or used for the first time.

          We only count a conflict as new when the conflict overall started that year, not if it restarted or changed its hostility level (i.e. escalated or deescalated).

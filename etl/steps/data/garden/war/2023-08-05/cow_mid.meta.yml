          Number of ongoing disputes in a given year.


          We count a conflict as ongoing in a region even if the conflict is also ongoing in other regions.
          The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing conflicts.

          • New disputes for the 'World': We only count a dispute as new when the dispute overall started that year, not if it restarted
          or its hostility level changed.

          • New disputes for all regions (except 'World'): We count a dispute as new in a region even if the dispute overall started
          earlier in another region. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of new disputes.

          • New disputes by hostility level: We only count a dispute as new when the dispute overall started that year, not if it changed
          its hostility level.

        description_short: Annual number of deaths in ongoing disputes
        description: >-
          The estimated number of fatalities in a year over the course of disputes.


          For some conflicts, data on the number of fatalities was missing (source field "FatalPre"). In such cases, we have used the lower bound from the range
          specified by the source field "Fatality". If this was also missing, we have set the value to zero. Consequently, the number of fatalities in ongoing
          disputes is likely to be underestimated.

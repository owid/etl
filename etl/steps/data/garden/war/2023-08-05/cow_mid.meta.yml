      This dataset contains information on interstate disputes in the period of 1816 and 2014.


      It has been constructed using the Correlates of War - Militarised Interstate Disputes v5.0 dataset.

      Data on the number of disputes and deaths from militarized disputes.


      A militarized dispute (MID) is based on a sequence of related militarized incidents, each of which (except the first)
      is an outgrowth of or a response to one or more previous incidents. To ensure that each MID is a unified and recognized
      episode of militarized incidents, particular attention should be given to continuity of location and issue, as well as
      the interpretations of observers.

        unit: disputes
        description_short: The annual number of ongoing disputes
        description: >-
          Number of ongoing disputes in a given year.


          We count a dispute as ongoing in a region even if the dispute is also ongoing in other regions.
          The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing disputes.


          The data is disaggregated by region and "hostility" or "fatality".

          "Fatality" gives lower and upper estimates on the total number of fatalities over the complete span of a dispute. These are the types:

            - No deaths

            - 1-25 deaths

            - 26-100 deaths

            - 101-250 deaths

            - 251-500 deaths

            - 501-999 deaths

            - > 999 deaths

            - Unknown


          "Hostility" provides a short description of the type of hostility. These are the types:

            - No militarized action

            - Threat to use force

            - Display of force

            - Use of force

            - War

          We count a dispute as new in a region even if the dispute is also ongoing in other regions.
          The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing disputes.


          The data is disaggregated by region and "hostility" or "fatality".

          NOTES:


          • New disputes for all regions (except 'World'): We count a dispute as new in a region even if the dispute overall started
          earlier in another region. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of new disputes.

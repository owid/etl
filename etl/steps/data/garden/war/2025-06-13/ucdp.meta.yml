      An armed conflict is a disagreement between organized groups, or between one organized group and civilians, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "state-based" -%>
      A state-based conflict is a conflict between two armed groups, at least one of which is a state, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "interstate" -%>
      An interstate conflict is a conflict between states that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "intrastate" -%>
      A civil conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. A non-state armed group can be a rebel group, criminal organization, or ethnic group. Foreign states can still be involved in a supporting role. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "intrastate (internationalized)" -%>
      A foreign-backed civil conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year, and at least one foreign state is involved in a supporting role. A non-state armed group can be a rebel group, criminal organization, or ethnic group. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "intrastate (non-internationalized)" -%>
      A domestic civil conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year, and no foreign state is involved in a supporting role. A non-state armed group can be a rebel group, criminal organization, or ethnic group. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "extrasystemic" -%>
      A colonial conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year, and takes place outside of the state's territory. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "non-state conflict" -%>
      A non-state conflict is a conflict between non-state armed groups, such as rebel groups, criminal organizations, or ethnic groups, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year. {definitions.all.conflict_type_base}.

      <%- elif conflict_type == "one-sided violence" -%>
      One-sided violence is the use of armed force by a state or non-state armed group against civilians that causes at least 25 civilian deaths during a year.

    location_conflicts_method: |-
      UCDP provides geographical coordinates of each conflict event. We have mapped these coordinates to countries by means of the Natural Earth dataset.

      In some instances, the event's coordinates fall within the borders of a country. Other times, the event's coordinates fall outside the borders of a country. In the latter case, we have mapped the event to the country that is closest to the event's coordinates.

      Conflict event with id "53238" and relid "PAK-2003-1-345-88" was assigned to "Siachen Glacier" by Natural Earth. We have mapped it to "Pakistan" following the text in the `where_description` field from the Natural Earth data, which refers to "Giang sector in Siachen, Pakistani Kashmir".

dataset:
  title: UCDP, History of war
  description: |-
    This dataset provides information on armed conflicts, using data from the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset (version 24.1), the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset (version 24.1), and the UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset (version 24.1).

    We aggregate the UCDP Georeferenced Event Dataset up to the year and world (region) to identify all conflict deaths, non-state conflicts, and one-sided violence.

    We use the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset to identify state-based conflicts: interstate, intrastate (all, internationalized, and non-internationalized), and extrasystemic.

    We use the UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset to link deaths in the Georeferenced Event Dataset to types of state-based conflicts in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset.

    We combine these datasets to provide information on the number of ongoing and new conflicts, the number of ongoing and new conflict types, as well as the number of deaths in ongoing conflicts and conflict types.

    Deaths of combatants and civilians due to fighting are included.

    The Georeferenced Event Dataset has been extracted from the UCDP systems at a certain point in time. However, the UCDP team works with the data all year round, including revisions and updates. Therefore, their dashboard
    might show slightly more up-to-date data, which sometimes result in minor discrepancies in the data.

    We use the world regions as defined by UCDP/PRIO: Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Middle East. These are defined based on Gleditsch and Ward codes. Find the complete mapping at
    http://ksgleditsch.com/data/iisystem.dat (states) and http://ksgleditsch.com/data/microstatessystem.dat (micro-states):

      • Americas: 2-199

      • Europe: 200-399

      • Africa: 400-626

      • Middle East: 630-699

      • Asia and Oceania: 700-999

    This dataset contains information on armed conflicts - state, non-state and one-sided conflicts, in the period of 1989 and 2022.

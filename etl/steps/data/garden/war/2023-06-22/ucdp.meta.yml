    The << estimate >> estimate of the number of deaths in all ongoing armed conflicts in each year. This includes interstate, intrastate, extrasystemic, and non-state conflicts, as well as one-sided violence.

    An ongoing armed conflict is a disagreement between organized groups, or between one organized group and civilians, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year.
    <% elif conflict_type == "interstate" %>
    The << estimate >> estimate of the number of deaths in ongoing interstate conflicts in each year.

    An interstate conflict is a conflict between states that causes at least 25 deaths during a year.

    The << estimate >> estimate of the number of deaths in ongoing intrastate conflicts in each year.

    An intrastate conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group that causes at least 25 deaths during a year.
    <% elif conflict_type == "intrastate (internationalized)" %>
    The << estimate >> estimate of the number of deaths in ongoing internationalized intrastate conflicts in each year.

    An internationalized intrastate conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group, with involvement of a foreign state, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year.
    <% elif conflict_type == "intrastate (non-internationalized)" %>
    The << estimate >> estimate of the number of deaths in ongoing non-internationalized intrastate conflicts in each year.

    A non-internationalized intrastate conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state armed group, without involvement of a foreign state, that causes at least 25 deaths during a year.
    <% elif conflict_type == "non-state conflict" %>
    The << estimate >> estimate of the number of deaths in ongoing non-state conflicts in each year.

    A non-state conflict is a conflict between non-state armed groups that causes at least 25 deaths during a year.
    <% elif conflict_type == "one-sided violence" %>
    The << estimate >> estimate of the number of deaths in conflicts of one-sided violence in each year.

    One-sided violence is the use of armed force by a state or non-state armed group against civilians that causes at least 25 deaths during a year.

dataset:
  title: History of war (UCDP, 2023)
  description: >-
    This dataset contains information on armed conflicts - state, non-state and one-sided conflicts, in the period of 1989 and 2022.


    It has been constructed using the Georeferenced Event Dataset version 23.1 by the UCDP.


    Note that the Geo-referenced Event Dataset has been extracted from the UCDP systems at a certaian point in time.
    However, the UCDP team works with the data all year round, including revisions and updates. Therefore, their dashboard
    might show slightly more up-to-date data, which sometimes result in minor discrepancies in the data.


    Regions: The regions are defined based on Gleditsch and Ward codes (GWno). Find complete mapping at

          Number of ongoing (active) conflicts in a given year.

          We count a conflict as ongoing in a region even if the conflict is also ongoing in other regions. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing conflicts.


          Active conflicts are those resulting into at least 25 deaths each year (based on most plausible estimate).

          Number of new (active) conflicts in a given year.


          • New conflicts for the 'World': We only count a conflict as new when the conflict overall started that year, not if it became active again.

          • New conflicts for all regions: We count a conflict as new in a region even if the conflict overall started earlier in another region.
          The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of new conflicts.

          • New conflicts by type: We only count an internationalized intrastate conflict as new when the conflict overall started that year, not if it became internationalized.
          We only count a non-internationalized intrastate conflict as new when the conflict overall started that year, not if it stopped being internationalized.


          Active conflicts are those resulting into at least 25 deaths each year (based on most plausible estimate).

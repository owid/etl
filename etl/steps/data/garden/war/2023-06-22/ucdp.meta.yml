      number_deaths_ongoing_conflicts:
        title: Number of deaths in ongoing conflicts (best estimate)
        unit: deaths
        description: >-
          The best (most likely) estimate of total fatalities in ongoing (active) conflicts in a given year.
          It includes deaths from both sides in the conflict, civilians and from persons of "unknown status".


          Active conflicts are those resulting into at least 25 deaths each year (based on most plausible estimate).

      number_deaths_ongoing_conflicts_high:
        title: Number of deaths in ongoing conflicts (high estimate)
        unit: deaths
        description: >-
          The highest reliable estimate of total fatalities in ongoing (active) conflicts in a given year.
          It includes deaths from both sides in the conflict, civilians and from persons of "unknown status".


          Active conflicts are those resulting into at least 25 deaths each year (based on most plausible estimate).

      number_deaths_ongoing_conflicts_low:
        title: Number of deaths in ongoing conflicts (low estimate)
        unit: deaths
        description: >-
          The lowest reliable estimate of total fatalities in ongoing (active) conflicts in a given year.
          It includes deaths from both sides in the conflict, civilians and from persons of "unknown status".


          Note that UCDP attempts to distinguish and not include unreasonable
          claims in the high estimate of fatalities, and tends to be highly conservative when counting
          fatalities

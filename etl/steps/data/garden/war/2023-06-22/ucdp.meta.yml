dataset:
  title: History of war (UCDP, 2023)
  description: >-
    This dataset contains information on armed conflicts - state, non-state and one-sided conflicts, in the period of 1989 and 2022.


    It has been constructed using the Georeferenced Event Dataset version 23.1 by the UCDP.


    Note that the Geo-referenced Event Dataset has been extracted from the UCDP systems at a certaian point in time.
    However, the UCDP team works with the data all year round, including revisions and updates. Therefore, their dashboard
    might show slightly more up-to-date data, which sometimes result in minor discrepancies in the data.


    Regions: The regions are defined based on Gleditsch and Ward codes (GWno). Find complete mapping at

      number_deaths_ongoing_conflicts:
        title: Number of deaths in ongoing conflicts (best estimate)
        unit: deaths
        description: >-
          The best (most likely) estimate of total fatalities in ongoing (active) conflicts in a given year.
          It includes deaths from both sides in the conflict, civilians and from persons of "unknown status".


          Active conflicts are those resulting into at least 25 deaths each year (based on most plausible estimate).

          It includes deaths from both sides in the conflict, civilians and from persons of "unknown status".

        description: >-
          The lowest reliable estimate of total fatalities in ongoing (active) conflicts in a given year.
          It includes deaths from both sides in the conflict, civilians and from persons of "unknown status".


          Note that UCDP attempts to distinguish and not include unreasonable
          claims in the high estimate of fatalities, and tends to be highly conservative when counting
          fatalities

          We count a conflict as ongoing in a region even if the conflict is also ongoing in other regions. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing conflicts.

          Number of new (active) conflicts in a given year.


          • New conflicts for the 'World': We only count a conflict as new when the conflict overall started that year, not if it became active again.

          • New conflicts for all regions: We count a conflict as new in a region even if the conflict overall started earlier in another region.
          The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of new conflicts.

          • New conflicts by type: We only count an internationalized intrastate conflict as new when the conflict overall started that year, not if it became internationalized.
          We only count a non-internationalized intrastate conflict as new when the conflict overall started that year, not if it stopped being internationalized.


          Active conflicts are those resulting into at least 25 deaths each year (based on most plausible estimate).

    The << estimate >> estimate of the number of deaths in all ongoing conventional wars in each year.

    An ongoing conventional war is a conflict between combatants with differentiated militaries and clear frontlines that causes at least 500 deaths over its duration.

    Deaths of combatants due to fighting are included.

    If a war lasted more than one year, we distributed its deaths evenly across years. If a war was ongoing in more than one world region, we distributed its deaths evenly across regions.

    The << estimate >> estimate of the number of deaths in ongoing conventional interstate wars in each year.

    An ongoing conventional interstate war is a conflict between combatants that are part of different political authorities, that involves differentiated militaries and clear frontlines, and that causes at least 500 deaths over its duration.

    We identify conventional interstate wars as those wars that are not coded civil wars by Project Mars.

    For the two wars that had campaigns within it that were a civil war and an interstate war, we coded them as interstate wars.

    Deaths of combatants due to fighting are included.

    If a war lasted more than one year, we distributed its deaths evenly across years. If a war was ongoing in more than one world region, we distributed its deaths across the regions of the participants.

    An ongoing conventional civil war is a conflict between combatants that were previously part of the same political authority, where now at least one seeks control or secession, that involves differentiated militaries and clear frontlines, and that causes at least 500 deaths over its duration.

dataset:
  title: History of war (Project Mars, 2020)
  description: |-
    This dataset provides information on conventional wars, using data from Jason Lyall's Project Mars.

    The project provides information on the number of ongoing and new wars, the number of ongoing and new war types, as well as the number of deaths in ongoing wars and war types.

    Deaths of combatants due to fighting are included.

    We use the world regions as defined by Project Mars: Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East, North America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Western Europe.

    You can find more information about the data in our article:

          We count a war as ongoing in a region even if the war is also ongoing in other regions. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing wars.

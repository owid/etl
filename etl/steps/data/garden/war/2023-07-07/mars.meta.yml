          We count a war as ongoing in a region even if the conflict is also ongoing in other regions.
          The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of ongoing wars.


          For the wars that had campaigns within it that were a civil war and a non-civil war, we coded them as non-civil wars.

          • New conflicts for the 'World': We only count a war as new when the war overall started that year, not if it restarted
          or a new campaign within it begins.

          • New conflicts for all regions (except 'World'): We count a war as new in a region even if the war overall started
          earlier in another region. The sum across all regions can therefore be higher than the total number of new wars.

          • New conflicts by type: We only count a civil war as new when the war overall started that year, not if it became a civil war.
          We only count a non-civil war as new when the war overall started that year, not if a civil war became internationalized.

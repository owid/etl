Rifampicin resistance is the ability of tuberculosis bacteria, to resist the effects of the antibiotic rifampicin due to genetic mutations, hindering the drug's ability to inhibit bacterial growth. Fluoroquinolones, bedaquiline and linezolid are antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis after first-line drugs such as rifampicin are no longer effective.
        description_from_producer: Number of new or previously treated bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis patients with resistance to rifampicin and fluoroquinolones, but with unknown resistance to bedaquiline and linezolid.

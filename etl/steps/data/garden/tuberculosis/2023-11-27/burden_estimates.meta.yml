    title: Global tuberculosis report
    description:
      WHO has published a global tuberculosis (TB) report every year since
      1997. The report provides a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the TB
      epidemic, and of progress in prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the disease
      at global, regional and country levels.

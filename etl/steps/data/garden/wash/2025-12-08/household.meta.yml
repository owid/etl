# Important: The WASH indicators use specific terminology, especially around service levels and "access" vs "usage". This should be respected and consistently applied throughout the metadata.
# From WASH-researchers: "A lot of governments track ‘access’ through infrastructure inventories, but the JMP relies more on population-based data on how many people use what type of infrastructure. We have been trying to not refer to “access” in JMP reports, and more generally in SDG reporting."

  sanitation_rationale: &sanitation_rationale |
    Having access to safe and comfortable sanitation facilities is essential to a healthy and dignified life. Improved sanitation facilities help prevent the spread of diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid by providing safe separation from human waste.
  basic_sanitation_desc: &basic_sanitation_desc |
    Basic sanitation services are defined as improved sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households.
  improved_sanitation_desc: &improved_sanitation_desc |
    Improved sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact, and include: flush/pour flush toilets connected to piped sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines; pit latrines with slabs (including ventilated pit latrines), and composting toilets.
  unimproved_sanitation_desc: &unimproved_sanitation_desc |
    Unimproved sanitation facilities include pit latrines without a slab or platform, hanging latrines or bucket latrines.
  limited_sanitation_desc: &limited_sanitation_desc |
    Limited sanitation services are defined as improved sanitation facilities that are shared with other households.
  open_defecation_desc: &open_defecation_desc |
    Open defecation refers to the practice of defecating in fields, forests, bushes, bodies of water or other open spaces.
  safely_managed_sanitation_desc: &safely_managed_sanitation_desc |
    Safely managed sanitation services are defined as improved sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed in situ or transported and treated off-site.
  drinking_water_rationale: &drinking_water_rationale |
    Easy and reliable access to drinking water is fundamental to human health and well-being. Improved drinking water sources reduce the risk of contamination and the spread of waterborne diseases.
  water_not_on_premises_desc: &water_not_on_premises_desc |
    Having to collect water from sources outside the home can be time-consuming and physically demanding. Spending hours each day collecting water can limit opportunities for education, employment, and community participation.
  water_on_premises_desc: &water_on_premises_desc |
    Having access to water on premises and when needed reduces the time and effort spent collecting water, which frees up time for education, work and participation in community life.
  basic_drinking_water_desc: &basic_drinking_water_desc |
    Basic drinking water services are defined as an [improved drinking water source](#dod:improved-water-source), provided collection time is not more than 30 minutes for a roundtrip including queuing.
  limited_drinking_water_desc: &limited_drinking_water_desc |
    Limited drinking water services are defined as drinking water from an improved source for which collection time exceeds 30 minutes for a roundtrip including queuing.
  improved_drinking_water_desc: &improved_drinking_water_desc |
    Improved drinking water sources are those that have the potential to deliver safe water by nature of their design and construction, and include: piped water, boreholes or tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, and packaged or delivered water.
  unimp_drinking_water_desc: &unimp_drinking_water_desc |
    Unimproved drinking water services are defined as drinking water from an unprotected dug well or unprotected spring.
  surface_water_desc: &surface_water_desc |
    Surface water includes rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, dams, canals and irrigation channels.
  safely_managed_water_desc: &safely_managed_water_desc |
    Safely managed drinking water services are defined as an [improved drinking water source](#dod:improved-water-source) that is located on premises, available when needed and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination.
  piped_water_desc: &piped_water_desc |
    Piped water refers to drinking water that is delivered through a pipe such as tap water on people's premises, their neighbor's premises, or a public tap/standpipe.
  non_piped_water_desc: &non_piped_water_desc |
    Non-piped improved drinking water sources include boreholes or tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, and packaged or delivered water, for example bottled water or tanker trucks.
  menstrual_materials_rationale: &menstrual_materials_rationale |
    Billions of girls and women around the world menstruate every month. Not having access to proper menstrual materials can prevent them from attending school, going to work, or participating in social activities. Using unsafe materials (such as toilet paper or dirty cloth) can also lead to infections and other health problems.
  menstrual_materials_desc_short: &menstrual_materials_desc_short |
    Menstrual materials include e.g. disposable or reusable pads, tampons, reusable cloths, menstrual cups, or absorbent underwear. They do not include toilet paper, tissues, or rags that are not designed for menstrual management.
  menstruation_materials_desc: &menstruation_materials_desc |
    Menstrual materials are products used to absorb or collect menstrual blood, such as disposable or reusable pads, tampons, reusable cloths, menstrual cups, or absorbent underwear. They do not include materials such as toilet paper, paper towels, tissues, or rags that are not specifically designed for menstrual management.
  reusable_menstruation_materials_desc: &reusable_menstruation_materials_desc |
    Reusable menstrual materials are products that can be washed and reused multiple times. Examples are reusable cloth pads, menstrual cups, or absorbent underwear.
  data_sources: &data_sources |
    This data is provided by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP). They compile data from nationally representative household surveys and censuses, administrative data and service provider data. To learn more, see the [JMP Methodology](https://washdata.org/topics/methods/data-sources).
  usage_vs_access: &usage_vs_access |
    This data reflects actual service use, which is directly linked to health outcomes and can be consistently measured across countries using household surveys. It is possible to theoretically have access to some kind of water and sanitation infrastructure, but not use them for daily needs. Therefore we refer to "use" or "using" rather than "access" to better reflect the underlying data.

  sanitation_rationale: &sanitation_rationale |
    Having access to safe and comfortable sanitation facilities is essential to a healthy and dignified life. Improved sanitation facilities help prevent the spread of diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid by providing safe separation from human waste.
  basic_sanitation_desc: &basic_sanitation_desc |
    Basic sanitation services are defined as improved sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households.
  improved_sanitation_desc: &improved_sanitation_desc |
    Improved sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact, and include: flush/pour flush toilets connected to piped sewer systems, septic tanks or pit latrines; pit latrines with slabs (including ventilated pit latrines), and composting toilets.
  unimproved_sanitation_desc: &unimproved_sanitation_desc |
    Unimproved sanitation facilities include pit latrines without a slab or platform, hanging latrines or bucket latrines.
  limited_sanitation_desc: &limited_sanitation_desc |
    Limited sanitation services are defined as improved sanitation facilities that are shared with other households.
  open_defecation_desc: &open_defecation_desc |
    Open defecation refers to the practice of defecating in fields, forests, bushes, bodies of water or other open spaces.
  safely_managed_sanitation_desc: &safely_managed_sanitation_desc |
    Safely managed sanitation services are defined as improved sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households and where excreta are safely disposed in situ or transported and treated off-site.
  drinking_water_rationale: &drinking_water_rationale |
    Easy and reliable access drinking water is fundamental to human health and well-being. Improved drinking water sources reduce the risk of contamination and the spread waterborne diseases.
  water_not_on_premises_desc: &water_not_on_premises_desc |
    Having to collect water from sources outside the home can be time-consuming and physically demanding. Spending hours each day collecting water can limit opportunities for education, employment, and community participation.
  water_on_premises_desc: &water_on_premises_desc |
    Having access to water on premises and when needed  reduces the time and effort spent collecting water, which frees up time for education, work and participation in community life.
  basic_drinking_water_desc: &basic_drinking_water_desc |
    Basic drinking water services are defined as an improved drinking water source, provided collection time is not more than 30 minutes for a roundtrip including queuing.
  limited_drinking_water_desc: &limited_drinking_water_desc |
    Limited drinking water services are defined as drinking water from an improved source for which collection time exceeds 30 minutes for a roundtrip including queuing.
  improved_drinking_water_desc: &improved_drinking_water_desc |
    Improved drinking water sources are those that have the potential to deliver safe water by nature of their design and construction, and include: piped water, boreholes or tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, and packaged or delivered water.
  unimp_drinking_water_desc: &unimp_drinking_water_desc |
    Unimproved drinking water services are defined as drinking water from an unprotected dug well or unprotected spring.
  surface_water_desc: &surface_water_desc |
    Surface water includes rivers, streams, ponds, lakes, dams, canals and irrigation channels.
  safely_managed_water_desc: &safely_managed_water_desc |
    Safely managed drinking water services are defined as an improved drinking water source that is located on premises, available when needed and free from faecal and priority chemical contamination.
  piped_water_desc: &piped_water_desc |
    Piped water refers to drinking water that is delivered through a pipe such as tap water on people's premises, their neighbor's premises, or a public tap/standpipe.
  non_piped_water_desc: &non_piped_water_desc |
    Non-piped improved drinking water sources include boreholes or tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, and packaged or delivered water, for example bottled water or tanker trucks.
  menstrual_materials_rationale: &menstrual_materials_rationale |
    Billions of girls and women around the world menstruate every month. Not having access to proper menstrual materials can prevent them from attending school, going to work, or participating in social activities. Using unsafe materials (such as toilet paper or dirty cloth) can also lead to infections and other health problems.
  menstrual_materials_desc_short: &menstrual_materials_desc_short |
    Menstrual materials include e.g. disposable or reusable pads, tampons, reusable cloths, menstrual cups, or absorbent underwear. They do not include toilet paper, tissues, or rags that are not designed for menstrual management.
  menstruation_materials_desc: &menstruation_materials_desc |
    Menstrual materials are products used to absorb or collect menstrual blood, such as disposable or reusable pads, tampons, reusable cloths, menstrual cups, or absorbent underwear. They do not include materials such as toilet paper, paper towels, tissues, or rags that are not specifically designed for menstrual management.
  reusable_menstruation_materials_desc: &reusable_menstruation_materials_desc |
    Reusable menstrual materials are products that can be washed and reused multiple times. Examples are reusable cloth pads, menstrual cups, or absorbent underwear.
  residence_desc: &residence_desc |
    {{ if residence == "Rural" }}

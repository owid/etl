        description: |
          The total number of eggs is calculated as the sum of eggs from barns, cages (including enriched cages), and free-range eggs (both non-organic and organic). Since there is no data for organic eggs prior to 2006, and given that they represented a small fraction of the total, we assume there were no organic eggs until that year.

    - This indicator uses data on aquaculture production tonnages and mean weights estimated from available fish size data.
    - |
      Note that this study does not include:
      - Non-fish species, e.g. lobsters.
      - Fish deaths arising in fish farms prior to harvest, in the capture of wild fish for feed or re-stocking, or from environmental impacts on surrounding wildlife.
      - Fish farmed for use as bait, whose small production tonnages may comprise large numbers of fish due to their very small size of just a few grams.
      - Species without an estimated mean weight (which were an additional 17% of reported global fish production).

            note: Due to large uncertainties, the chart shows upper and lower bounds, and midpoint values (also shown in the map), which are the average of those bounds.

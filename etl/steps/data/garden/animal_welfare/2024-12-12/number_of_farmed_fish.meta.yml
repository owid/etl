    - This indicator uses data on aquaculture production tonnages and mean weights estimated from available fish size data.
    - |
      Note that this study does not include:
      - Non-fish species, e.g. lobsters.
      - Fish deaths arising in fish farms prior to harvest, in the capture of wild fish for feed or re-stocking, or from environmental impacts on surrounding wildlife.
      - Fish farmed for use as bait, whose small production tonnages may comprise large numbers of fish due to their very small size of just a few grams.
    # - Data at the country level prior to 2020 does not include species without an estimated mean weight (which were an additional 17% of reported global fish production).

  # Attack type descriptions
  description_key_armed_assault: &description_key_armed_assault |-
    An armed assault is determined to be successful if the assault takes place and if a target is hit (including people and/or property). Unsuccessful armed assaults are those in which the perpetrators attack and do not hit the target. An armed assault is also unsuccessful if the perpetrators are apprehended on their way to commit the assault. To make this determination, however, there must be information to indicate that an actual assault was imminent.

  description_key_assassination: &description_key_assassination |-
    An attack whose primary objective is to cause physical harm or death directly to human beings by use of a firearm, incendiary, or sharp instrument (knife, etc.). Not to include attacks involving the use of fists, rocks, sticks, or other handheld (less-than-lethal) weapons. Also includes attacks involving certain classes of explosive devices in addition to firearms, incendiaries, or sharp instruments. The explosive device subcategories that are included in this classification are grenades, projectiles, and unknown or other explosive devices that are thrown.

  description_key_bombing: &description_key_bombing |-
    An attack where the primary effects are caused by an energetically unstable material undergoing rapid decomposition and releasing a pressure wave that causes physical damage to the surrounding environment. Can include either high or low explosives (including a dirty bomb) but does not include a nuclear explosive device that releases energy from fission and/or fusion, or an incendiary device where decomposition takes place at a much slower rate.

    If an attack involves certain classes of explosive devices along with firearms, incendiaries, or sharp objects, then the attack is coded as an armed assault only. The explosive device subcategories that are included in this classification are grenades, projectiles, and unknown or other explosive devices that are thrown in which the bombers are also using firearms or incendiary devices.

  description_key_infrastructure_attack: &description_key_infrastructure_attack |-
    An act, excluding the use of an explosive, whose primary objective is to cause damage to a non-human target, such as a building, monument, train, pipeline, etc. Such attacks include arson and various forms of sabotage (e.g., sabotaging a train track is a facility/infrastructure attack, even if passengers are killed). Facility/infrastructure attacks can include acts which aim to harm an installation, yet also cause harm to people incidentally (e.g. an arson attack primarily aimed at damaging a building, but causes injuries or fatalities).

  description_key_hijacking: &description_key_hijacking |-
    An act whose primary objective is to take control of a vehicle such as an aircraft, boat, bus, etc. for the purpose of diverting it to an unprogrammed destination, force the release of prisoners, or some other political objective. Obtaining payment of a ransom should not the sole purpose of a hijacking, but can be one element of the incident so long as additional objectives have also been stated. Hijackings are distinct from Hostage Taking because the target is a vehicle, regardless of whether there are people/passengers in the vehicle.

  description_key_hostage_barricade: &description_key_hostage_barricade |-
    An act whose primary objective is to take control of hostages for the purpose of achieving a political objective through concessions or through disruption of normal operations. Such attacks are distinguished from kidnapping since the incident occurs and usually plays out at the target location with little or no intention to hold the hostages for an extended period in a separate clandestine location.

  description_key_hostage_kidnapping: &description_key_hostage_kidnapping |-
    An act whose primary objective is to take control of hostages for the purpose of achieving a political objective through concessions or through disruption of normal operations. Kidnappings are distinguished from barricading in that they involve moving and holding the hostages in another location.

  description_key_unarmed_assault: &description_key_unarmed_assault |-
    An attack whose primary objective is to cause physical harm or death directly to human beings by any means other than explosive, firearm, incendiary, or sharp instrument (knife, etc.). Attacks involving chemical, biological or radiological weapons are considered unarmed assaults.

  description_key_unknown_attack: &description_key_unknown_attack |-
    The attack type cannot be determined from the available information.

  # Fatalities description
  description_key_fatalities: &description_key_fatalities |-
    This field stores the number of total confirmed fatalities for the incident. The number includes all victims and attackers who died as a direct result of the incident.

    Where there is evidence of fatalities, but a figure is not reported or it is too vague to be of use, this field remains blank. If information is missing regarding the number of victims killed in an attack, but perpetrator fatalities are known, this value will reflect only the number of perpetrators who died as a result of the incident. Likewise, if information on the number of perpetrators killed in an attack is missing, but victim fatalities are known, this field will only report the number of victims killed in the incident.

    Where several independent sources report different numbers of fatalities, the database will usually reflect the number given by the most recent source. However, the most recent source will not be used if the source itself is of questionable validity or if the source bases its death numbers on claims made by a perpetrator group. When there are several "most recent" sources published around the same time, or there are concerns about the validity of a recent source, the majority figure will be used. Where there is no majority figure among independent sources, the database will record the lowest proffered fatality figure, unless that figure comes from a source of questionable validity or there is another compelling reason to do otherwise. Conflicting reports of fatalities will be noted in the "Additional Notes" field.

  # Injuries description
  description_key_injuries: &description_key_injuries |-
    This field records the number of confirmed non-fatal injuries to both perpetrators and victims.

    Where there is evidence of non-fatal injuries, but a figure is not reported or it is too vague to be of use, this field remains blank. If information is missing regarding the number of victims killed in an attack, but perpetrator fatalities are known, this value will reflect only the number of perpetrators who died as a result of the incident. Likewise, if information on the number of perpetrators killed in an attack is missing, but victim fatalities are known, this field will only report the number of victims killed in the incident.

    Where several independent sources report different numbers of non-fatal injuries, the database will usually reflect the number given by the most recent source. However, the most recent source will not be used if the source itself is of questionable validity or if the source bases its non-fatal injuries on claims made by a perpetrator group. When there are several "most recent" sources published around the same time, or there are concerns about the validity of a recent source, the majority figure will be used. Where there is no majority figure among independent sources, the database will record the lowest proffered non-fatal injuries figure, unless that figure comes from a source of questionable validity or there is another compelling reason to do otherwise. Conflicting reports of fatalities will be noted in the "Additional Notes" field.

  # Terrorist attacks definition
  description_key_terrorist_attacks: &description_key_terrorist_attacks |-
    The GTD defines a terrorist attack as the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. In practice this means in order to consider an incident for inclusion in the GTD, all three of the following attributes must be present:

    - The incident must be intentional - the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator.
    - The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence -including property violence, as well as violence against people.
    - The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. The database does not include acts of state terrorism.

    In addition, at least two of the following three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in the GTD:

    - Criterion 1: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. In terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion. It must involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic change.
    - Criterion 2: There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims. It is the act taken as a totality that is considered, irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention. As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.
    - Criterion 3: The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. That is, the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law, insofar as it targets non-combatants.

  desc_uncertainty: &desc_uncertainty |-
      In some cases, it is unclear whether an incident fully meets all inclusion criteria. In these ambiguous situations, terrorism is considered probable but not certain, and such incidents are nonetheless included in the dataset.

      For example, GTD includes non-state attacks with political or ideological motives—whether targeted killings, infrastructure sabotage, or even 5G mast arson linked to conspiracy theories. It excludes state terrorism, lawful warfare, and non-political violence like most U.S. school shootings, profit-driven crimes, and personal disputes.

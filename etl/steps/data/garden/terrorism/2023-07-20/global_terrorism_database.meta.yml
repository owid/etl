        unit: 'deaths'
        description: >
          This field stores the number of total confirmed fatalities for the incident. The number includes all victims and attackers who died as a direct result of the incident.


          Where there is evidence of fatalities, but a figure is not reported or it is too vague to be of use, this field remains blank. If information is missing regarding the number of victims killed in an attack, but perpetrator fatalities are known, this value will reflect only the number of perpetrators who died as a result of the incident. Likewise, if information on the number of perpetrators killed in an attack is missing, but victim fatalities are known, this field will only report the number of victims killed in the incident.


          Where several independent sources report different numbers of fatalities, the database will usually reflect the number given by the most recent source. However, the most recent source will not be used if the source itself is of questionable validity or if the source bases its death numbers on claims made by a perpetrator group. When there are several “most recent” sources published around the same time, or there are concerns about the validity of a recent source, the majority figure will be used. Where there is no majority figure among independent sources, the database will record the lowest proffered fatality figure, unless that figure comes from a source of questionable validity or there is another compelling reason to do otherwise. Conflicting reports of fatalities will be noted in the “Additional Notes” field.

        title: Terrorist attacks
        unit: 'attacks'
        description: >
          The GTD defines a terrorist attack as the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non- state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. In practice this means in order to consider an incident for inclusion in the GTD, all three of the following attributes must be present:


          - The incident must be intentional – the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator.


          - The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence -including property violence, as well as violence against people.


          - The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. The database does not include acts of state terrorism.


          In addition, at least two of the following three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in the GTD:


          - Criterion 1: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. In terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion. It must involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic change.


          - Criterion 2: There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims. It is the act taken as a totality that is considered, irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention. As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.


          - Criterion 3: The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. That is, the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law, insofar as it targets non-combatants

If information is missing regarding the number of victims killed in an attack, but perpetrator fatalities are known, this value will reflect only the number of perpetrators who died as a result of the incident.

Unsuccessful armed assaults are those in which the perpetrators attack and do not hit the target. An armed assault is also unsuccessful if the perpetrators are apprehended on their way to commit the assault. To make this determination, however, there must be information to indicate that an actual assault was imminent.

          This field records the number of confirmed non-fatal injuries to both perpetrators and victims.


          Where there is evidence of non-fatal injuries, but a figure is not reported or it is too vague to be of use, this field remains blank. If information is missing regarding the number of victims killed in an attack, but perpetrator fatalities are known, this value will reflect only the number of perpetrators who died as a result of the incident. Likewise, if information on the number of perpetrators killed in an attack is missing, but victim fatalities are known, this field will only report the number of victims killed in the incident.


          Where several independent sources report different numbers of non-fatal injuries, the database will usually reflect the number given by the most recent source. However, the most recent source will not be used if the source itself is of questionable validity or if the source bases its non-fatal injuries on claims made by a perpetrator group. When there are several “most recent” sources published around the same time, or there are concerns about the validity of a recent source, the majority figure will be used. Where there is no majority figure among independent sources, the database will record the lowest proffered non-fatal injuries figure, unless that figure comes from a source of questionable validity or there is another compelling reason to do otherwise. Conflicting reports of fatalities will be noted in the “Additional Notes” field.

          The GTD defines a terrorist attack as the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non- state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. In practice this means in order to consider an incident for inclusion in the GTD, all three of the following attributes must be present:


          - The incident must be intentional – the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator.


          - The incident must entail some level of violence or immediate threat of violence -including property violence, as well as violence against people.


          - The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. The database does not include acts of state terrorism.


          In addition, at least two of the following three criteria must be present for an incident to be included in the GTD:


          - Criterion 1: The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or social goal. In terms of economic goals, the exclusive pursuit of profit does not satisfy this criterion. It must involve the pursuit of more profound, systemic economic change.


          - Criterion 2: There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate, or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims. It is the act taken as a totality that is considered, irrespective if every individual involved in carrying out the act was aware of this intention. As long as any of the planners or decision-makers behind the attack intended to coerce, intimidate or publicize, the intentionality criterion is met.


          - Criterion 3: The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities. That is, the act must be outside the parameters permitted by international humanitarian law, insofar as it targets non-combatants

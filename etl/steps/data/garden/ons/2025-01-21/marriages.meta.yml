          - Ages are presented as "exact years," meaning "by age 30" includes marriages up to the day before the 30th birthday.
          - Since 2014, data includes marriages with opposite- and same-sex partners. Civil partnerships converted into marriages are also counted as "ever married," assuming a prior status of "never married or civil partnered" when prior marital status is unknown.
          - The table includes final figures for 2022. For instance, men born in 2002 were tracked for marriages up to their 21st birthday in 2022.
          - Marital status estimates are derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS).

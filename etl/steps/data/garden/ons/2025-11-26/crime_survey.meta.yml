    - "Survey data covers different time periods: 1981 to 1999 data are for calendar years; from year ending (YE) March 2002 onwards data are for the 12 months before the interview."
    - Estimates for 2021 and 2022 are not available because of the suspension of face-to-face interviewing between March 2020 and October 2021, during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

      - We combined data from multiple sources (Gapminder, WHO mortality database, UN world population prospects, UN MMEIG) to display the historic development of maternal mortality.
        The years before 1985 are based on the WHO mortality database and the UN WPP where available, and the Gapminder data set otherwise. The years after 1985 are based on the UN MMEIG data set.
      - For the years between 1950 - 1985 we calculated the maternal mortality ratio and maternal mortality rate based
        on the number of maternal deaths from the WHO mortality database and live births and female population of reproductive age from the UN WPP.
      - Where a data point is attached to a range of years in the Gapminder data set, we used the midpoint of the range.
      - The UN MMEIG data shown (post 1985) is the point estimate - this means there is a 50% chance that the true measure lies above this point,
        and a 50% chance that the true value lies below this point.
      - We calculated regional aggregates by summing the maternal deaths and live births
        of all countries in the region and then calculating the MMR based on these figures.
  description_maternal_mortality: |-
    Maternal deaths are defined as a death of a woman while pregnant or
    within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration
    and site of pregnancy, from any cause related or aggravated by the pregnancy
    or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.

  title: Maternal mortality (Gapminder/UN MMEIG, long run)
  description: |-
    Long run data set constructured from Gapminder and UN MMEIG data. The years between 1950 - 1985 are based on the WHO mortality data set (recorded deaths) and the UN WPP (estimated numbers) (where available)
    and the Gapminder data set (recorded data) otherwise. All data points before 1950 are based on the Gapminder data set. The years after 1985 are based on the estimations of the UN MMEIG.

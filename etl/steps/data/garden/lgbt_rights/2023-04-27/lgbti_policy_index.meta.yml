      We estimated regional aggregations by using [Our World in Data definitions of regions](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions) and our [consolidated population data](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources).

  policy_robustness_1: |-
    This policy is not measured in a binary (adopted/not-adopted) scheme; the author follows Frank and colleagues ([2010](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25782170), [2017](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26166859)) in considering that similar policies can meaningfully vary in scope, benefits, punishment, etc. So, he determines the robustness of each policy by reviewing five indicators.

  policy_robustness_2: |-
    These indicators are (between parentheses are the scoring schemes): *Proportion of Population Living Under Law*, to acknowledge subnational variations (0-1), *Scope of Genders Subject to Law*, as they can be typically differentiated by gender (0: no law, 0.5: just men or women, 1: both), *Maximum Level of Punishment*, for regressive policies (0: no law, 0.2: less than 3 years, 0.4: over 3 years and less than 15 years, 0.6: over 15 years and less than life in prison, 0.8: life in prison, 1: death penality), *Ease of Access*, to benefits the law outlines (0: no law, 0.25: significant barriers, 0.5: moderate barriers, 0.75: little to few barriers, 1: no barriers, and *Evidence of Enforcement* that considers whether at least one case has happenedthe previous year where this was implemented (0: no evidence, 1: evidence).

  policy_robustness_3: |-
    At least three different indicators are used to estimate the policy score, with the result that each policy score ranges from 0 to 1. Therefore, a score of 1 corresponds to that policy's most robust scope and implementation. This also means that changes in any indicator will influence each policy’s overall score.

  lgbt_index_1: |-
    These policies that define the index are subdivided between progressive policies and regressive policies. Among the progressive policies are: Same-sex sexual acts Legal, Equal Age of Consent, Employment Discrimination, Hate Crime Protections, Incitement to Hatred, Civil Unions, Marriage Equality, *oint Adoptions, Gender Marker Change, LGB Military, Transgender Military, Ban on Conversion Therapies, and Ban on Gender Assignment Surgeries on Children.

  lgbt_index_2: |-
    On the other hand, the regressive policies are: Death Penalty for Same-Sex Sexual Acts, Propaganda Laws, Same-Sex Sexual Acts Illegal, Unequal Age of Consent, and Ban on Marriage Equality.

  lgbt_index_3: |-
    To create the index, the scores for each policy are summed together annually, with progressive policies receiving a positive score and regressive policies receiving a negative score. This results in an index ranging from -5 to +13. No country reaches these extremes, demonstrating that countries can get better and worse in their policy environments.

  count_yes: |-
    This is the number of countries per region with full implementation of the policy.

  count_no: |-
    This is the number of countries per region with partial or no implementation of the policy.

  pop_yes: |-
    This is the population per region with full implementation of the policy.

  pop_no: |-
    This is the population per region with partial or no implementation of the policy.

  equal_age: Measures the presence of a law defining the same age of consent between same-sex and different-sex partners.
  unequal_age: Measures the presence of a law outlawing different ages of consent between same-sex and different-sex partners, which serves as a tool to inhibit same-sex acts between consenting adults.
  constitution: National constitutions are classified as protective against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity if there is explicit language or if judicial cases have set legal precedent for such protections.  This variable is not used to calculate the LGBTI index.
  conversion_therapies: Measures if bans on conversion therapies are adopted. Conversion therapies are those attempting to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. They can entail counseling, drugging, electric shocks, castrations, or brain surgery.
  death_penalty: Measures the adoption of policies that allow for individuals caught engaging in same-sex acts to be punished by death.
  employment_discrim: Measures the presence of legislation banning employers from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
  gender_surgery: Measures if bans on gender assignment surgeries on children are adopted.
  hate_crimes: Measures the adoption of hate crime laws, which designate a crime against someone based based on sexual orientation or gender identity as an aggravating circumstance.
  incite_hate: Measures the adoption of incitement to hatred protections, which is any act that could provoke a targeted crime illegal.
  joint_adoption: Measures if joint adoption policy is adopted. This policy allows for same-sex partners to legally adopt a child, with both parents being recognized as such.
  lgb_military: Measures if lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are allowed to serve in the military.
  lgb_military_ban: Measures if lesbian, gay, and bisexual people are banned from the military. This variable is not used to calculate the LGBTI index.
  marriage_equality: Measures if there is no legal distinction between same-sex and different-sex marriages.
  marriage_ban: Measures if same-sex marriages are banned.
  samesex_legal: Measures the presence of a law declaring that same-sex actions are not criminalized between consenting adults.
  third_gender: Measures if a third gender is recognized in the legislation. This variable is not used to calculate the LGBTI index.
  trans_military: Measures if transgender people are allowed to serve in the military.
  samesex_illegal: Measures the presence of a law declaring that same-sex actions are criminalized between consenting adults.
  civil_unions: Measures if civil unions for same-sex partners are adopted. Domestic and registered partnerships are included.
  gendermarker: Measures if the gender marker can be legally changed.
  propaganda: Measures the adoption of policies banning “propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations”. Vaguely written, these laws are utilized to discriminate against LGBT individuals in the name of protecting “public morality, particularly pertaining to children”.

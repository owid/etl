      - We have extracted the data from the official [Equaldex JSON API](https://equaldex.stoplight.io/docs/equaldex/d033e28a5cf0c-equaldex-json-api).
      - We combine the historical and current data extracted from the API to create a time series.
      - Whenever policy implementation dates for a status are not provided in the data, and this status is the only available for the country, we consider that this status has not changed during the entire period of the dataset.
      - We group some of the categories the source has defined for each issue, for further clarity in our visualizations.
      - We present this data only for sovereign states, defined by [Butcher and Griffiths (2020)](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/sovereign-state-butcher-griffiths). We use the definitions of the latest year available.

  description_from_producer_equality_index: |-
    Equaldex's Equality Index is a rating from 0 to 100 (with 100 being the most equal) to help visualize the legal rights and public attitudes towards LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex...) people in each region. The Equality Index is an average of two indexes: the legal index and the public opinion Index.

  description_from_producer_legal_index: |-
    The LGBT legal index measures the current legal status of 15 different issues ranging from the legal status of homosexuality, same-sex marriage, transgender rights, LGBT discrimination protections, LGBT censorship laws, and more. Each topic is weighted differently (for example, if same-sex marriage is illegal in a region, it would have a much bigger impact on the score than not allowing LGBT people to serve in the military). Each topic is assigned a "total possible score" and a "score" is assigned based the status of the law using a rating scale that ranges from 0% to 100% (for example, if homosexuality is legal, it would would receive a score of 100, but if it's illegal, it would receve a score of 0.)

    If the status of an issue is unknown, not applicable, or no data has not been added to Equaldex, the issue's score is completely discarded and not included in the ranking. In cases where a law varies throughout a region (for example, a country where same-sex marriage is legal in some states or provinces but not others), the score is averaged among all states or provinces, weighted equally.

    Past laws that are no longer in effect do not impact the region's current score. New laws that have not gone into effect yet will not impact the region's score until the day it goes into effect.

    Legal Index = (Total Possible Score for each issue × Factor of Status of Issue) / Sum of all Total Possible Scores

    More details about the scores and factors are available in the [Equaldex Equality Index methodology](https://www.equaldex.com/equality-index).

  description_from_producer_public_opinion_index: |-
    The LGBT public opinion index measures the public attitudes towards LGBT people using surveys and polls from reputable organizations. This index is scored based on averaging the results of all surveys in a given region. Generally, the value averaged is usually the most “equal” response in the poll. For example, if a poll asked “Do you support same-sex marriage?” and 56% of people said “yes”, the value “56” would be used. In some cases, a survey may be weighted less if the survey is very specific or includes a specific group of people (such as Christians) and might not be a full representation of the overall attitudes of the region.

    To better represent current attitudes, surveys are scored using a time-decay weighting method based on the date published. This means that the most recent surveys carry more weight in the public opinion index. Surveys from the current year and the previous year receive full weight. However, for surveys older than two years, an exponential decay of 75% applies each year. This weight decay ensures that the public opinion index is always most influenced by the most recent data, reflecting evolving public attitudes, while still taking into account older surveys to maintain a comprehensive overview. This change went into effect on July 21, 2023.

    Note that public opinion data is not available in every region. In these cases, the Equality Index will only be a representation of the legal rights of LGBT people in the region. Additionally, some regions have no recent public opinion data available, so older data is used to score the region.

    Public Opinion Index = (Survey Results Value × Survey Weight × Time Decay Factor) / (Survey Weight × Time Decay Factor)

    More details about decay factors are available in the [Equaldex Equality Index methodology](https://www.equaldex.com/equality-index).

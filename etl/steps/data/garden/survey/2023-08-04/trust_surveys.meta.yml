      The indicators are processed from microdata of several different regional surveys using Stata. Weights are applied in each country.

      The European Social Survey uses a 1-10 scale to measure interpersonal trust, where higher values represent higher trust. To make this data comparable with other surveys, we selected the answers with a score from 6 to 10 and calculated the percentage of the total number of answers.

  # description: |
  #   This dataset combines trust questions from the European Social Survey (ESS) and several regional barometers.

  #   The main question in the dataset relates to interpersonal trust:
  #   - ESS: "Would you say that most people can be trusted or that you cannot be too careful?"
  #   - Latinobarómetro: "Would you say that you can trust most people, or that you can never be too careful in dealing with others?"

  #   Though in the ESS the question is asked in a 0-10 scale, we only consider the answers from 6 to 10 as "agreeing" that most people can be trusted. In the Latinobarómetro, we only consider the answers "One can trust most people" as "agreeing" that most people can be trusted.

dataset:
  title: Trust questions in the European Social Survey and several regional barometers
  update_period_days: 365
  description: |
    This dataset combines trust questions from the European Social Survey (ESS) and regional barometers: Latinobarómetro and Afrobarometer.

    The main question in the dataset relates to interpersonal trust:
    - ESS: "Would you say that most people can be trusted or that you cannot be too careful?"
    - Latinobarómetro: "Would you say that you can trust most people, or that you can never be too careful in dealing with others?"
    - Afrobarometer: "Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you must be very careful in dealing with people?"

    Though in the ESS the question is asked in a 0-10 scale, we only consider the answers from 6 to 10 as "agreeing" that most people can be trusted. In the Latinobarómetro and Afrobarometer survets, we only consider the answers "One can trust most people" as "agreeing" that most people can be trusted.

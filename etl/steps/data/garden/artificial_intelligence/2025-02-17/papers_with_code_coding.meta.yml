        title: Coding competitions
        description_key:
          - This benchmark measures the accuracy of models in coding competitions based on the APPS benchmark. The APPS benchmark focuses on coding ability and problem-solving in a natural language context. It aims to replicate the evaluation process used for human programmers by presenting coding problems in unrestricted natural language and assessing the correctness of solutions.

          - The coding tasks included in this benchmark are sourced from open-access coding websites such as Codeforces and Kattis. These tasks span a range of difficulty levels, from introductory to collegiate competition level. The benchmark evaluates the accuracy of models in solving programming tasks specifically designed for coding competitions.

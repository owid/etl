        title: Total metered electricity consumption
        unit: Gigawatt hours
        short_unit: GWh
        description_short: Total electricity consumption from all metered customers in Ireland
        description_key:
          - This includes all metered electricity consumption across Ireland, including data centres, residential, commercial, and industrial customers.

      data_centres:
        title: Data centres electricity consumption
        unit: Gigawatt hours
        short_unit: GWh
        description_short: Electricity consumption by data centres in Ireland
        description_key:
          - Data centres were identified by examining around 2.5 million meters to identify Meter Point Reference Numbers (MPRNs) with high electricity consumption that were not associated with high employment nor with other activities such as cement manufacture.
          - The CSO continuously monitors for both new Meter Point Reference Numbers for existing data centres as well as for new data centres.

        description_short: Electricity consumption by all customers except data centres
        description_key:
          - This includes residential, commercial, and industrial customers, but excludes data centres.

        description_short: Data centre electricity consumption as a percentage of total metered consumption
        description_key:
          - Calculated as (data centre consumption / total metered consumption) × 100.
          - This indicator shows the growing share of electricity consumed by data centres in Ireland.

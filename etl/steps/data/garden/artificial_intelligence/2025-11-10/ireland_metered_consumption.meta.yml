    - Metered consumption refers to usage recorded by physical electricity meters (actual or estimated reads). It excludes flat-rate or unmetered services and network losses.
    - Because there is no single definition of a data center, the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Ireland identified them using electricity consumption data rather than formal classifications.
    - The CSO analysed roughly 2.5 million electricity meters to find sites that used large amounts of power but had few employees and were not involved in manufacturing.
    - Identification was based on several checks, including known data center operators, high-use business park customers, and meters consuming more than 1 GWh per year.
    - The data can be updated retrospectively as new facilities are identified and as electricity use changes over time.

          - This includes all metered electricity consumption across Ireland, covering data centers, residential, commercial, and industrial customers.
          - Metered consumption refers to usage recorded by physical electricity meters (actual or estimated reads). It excludes flat-rate or unmetered services and network losses.
          - The data is sourced from around 2.5 million meters connected to the mains electricity network.
          - Data for all years are subject to revision as new meters are identified or classifications are corrected.

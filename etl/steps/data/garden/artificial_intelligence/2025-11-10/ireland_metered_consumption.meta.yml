    - Data centres were identified by examining around 2.5 million meters to find facilities with high electricity consumption that were not associated with high employment or other activities like manufacturing.
    - Central Statistics Office of Ireland used four main approaches to identify data centres, including searching for known data centre names with consumption above 0.5 gigawatt hours, examining customers in specific business parks, and reviewing all meters with annual consumption above 1 gigawatt hour.
    - There is no agreed definition of a data centre, so identification relies on consumption patterns and business activity analysis.
    - A small number of data centres account for most of the metered electricity consumption by data centres.
    - Data for all years are subject to revision as new data centres are identified or as consumption patterns change. New data centres may initially be below detection thresholds.

          - This includes all metered electricity consumption across Ireland, covering data centres, residential, commercial, and industrial customers.
          - The data is sourced from around 2.5 million meters connected to the mains electricity network.
          - Data for all years are subject to revision as new meters are identified or classifications are corrected.

          - The classification is based on the CSO's identification of Meter Point Reference Numbers (MPRNs) associated with data centre activity.
          - Data for all years are subject to revision as data centre classifications are updated.

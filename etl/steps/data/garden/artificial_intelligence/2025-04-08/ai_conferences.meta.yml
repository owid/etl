          - AI conferences serve as essential platforms for researchers to present their findings and network with peers and collaborators.
          - Over the past two decades, these conferences have expanded in scale, quantity, and prestige.
          - Attendance data should be interpreted with caution, as many conferences in recent years have adopted virtual or hybrid formats.
          - Virtual conferences often attract larger and more global audiences, but exact attendance figures are harder to measure.
          - The AI Index reports total attendance, including virtual, hybrid, and in-person participation, across conferences such as AAAI, NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, EMNLP, ICLR, and others.
          - The significant spike in ICML attendance in 2021 was likely due to the conference being held virtually that year.

  description_short_industrial: Industrial robots are automated, reprogrammable machines that perform a variety of tasks in industrial settings.
  description_short_professional:  Professional service robots are semi- or fully autonomous machines that perform useful tasks in a professional setting outside of industrial applications, such as in cleaning or medical surgery. Consumer service robots are not included.

          - Agriculture category includes robots used for tasks such as plowing, seeding, harvesting, weeding, fertilizing, and pesticide spraying—both indoors (e.g. greenhouses) and outdoors (e.g. fields and vineyards). It also covers robots for milking, as well as those used in other livestock activities like feeding and barn cleaning.
          - Professional cleaning category includes robots designed to clean floors, windows, walls, tanks, pipes, and vehicle hulls in professional environments. This category also includes disinfection robots and others used for specialized or large-scale cleaning tasks.
          - Transportation and logistics category includes robots that transport goods and manage inventory in both indoor and outdoor environments. These robots are used in places such as warehouses, hospitals, hotels, and public streets, and they support activities like deliveries, stock counting, and restocking.
          - Medical and health care category includes robots used in clinical and care settings for diagnostics, surgery, rehabilitation, and non-invasive therapy. It also includes hospital support robots, wearable exoskeletons, and telepresence robots used specifically in healthcare.
          - Hospitality category includes robots that prepare and serve food or drinks, as well as those that provide information, guidance, or remote presence in customer-facing environments like hotels, restaurants, and museums.

          - The use of robots with AI-based software shows how AI is being applied in the real world.
          - Industrial robots are machines used in factories to automate tasks like welding, assembly, and packaging.
          - They are defined as automatically controlled, reprogrammable, and multipurpose machines that can move in three or more directions.
          - Reprogrammable means their functions can be changed through software without altering their physical parts.
          - Multipurpose means they can be adapted for different tasks with mechanical changes.
          - Robots are becoming easier to install and more flexible, which means even small production runs can be automated.
          - Companies use robots to improve product quality, increase speed, reduce waste, and cut costs.

        description_key:
        - The operational stock of robots refers to the number of robots currently in use.
        - In Japan, this is measured directly by the Japan Robot Association (JARA).
        - In other countries, the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) estimates the stock by summing robot installations over the past 12 years. This assumes robots are withdrawn after 12 years of service.
        - This 12-year assumption may be conservative - a pilot study suggested the average service life could be closer to 15 years.
        - Tax guidelines in Germany and the US assume shorter lifespans of 5 to 6 years, though these may underestimate actual use due to refurbishment.
        - The actual service life likely depends on the industry, application, and type of robot. More research is needed to improve these estimates.

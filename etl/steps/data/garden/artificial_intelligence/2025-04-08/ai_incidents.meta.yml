          - The AI Incident Database (AIID) tracks cases of ethical misuse of AI, such as fatal accidents or wrongful arrests caused by AI systems.
          - It relies on public media reports, so the actual number of incidents is likely underreported.
          - In 2024, there was active discussion around how to define and track “serious” incidents, but no agreed standard has emerged.
          - These conversations highlight the need for better reporting to more accurately document AI-related risks and their consequences.
          - The number of AI incidents is continuously updated, including for past years, so the numbers reported here may differ from the latest figures on the AI Incident Database.

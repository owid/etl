  title: Share of women among new artificial intelligence and computer science PhDs in the US and Canada (AI Index, 2023)
  description: >
    The CRA Taulbee Survey is the principal source of information on the enrollment, production, and employment
    of Ph.D.s in information, computer science and computer engineering (I, CS & CE) and in providing salary and demographic
    data for faculty in I, CS & CE in North America. Statistics given include gender and ethnicity breakdowns.

    The AI Index is an independent initiative at the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.
    The mission of the AI Index is “to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, and globally sourced data for policymakers, researchers, executives, journalists, and the general public to develop intuitions about the complex field of AI.”
    Their flagship output is the annual AI Index Report, which has been published since 2017.

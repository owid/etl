        description: >
          This benchmark measures the accuracy of models in coding competitions based on the APPS benchmark. The APPS benchmark focuses on coding ability and problem-solving in a natural language context. It aims to replicate the evaluation process used for human programmers by presenting coding problems in unrestricted natural language and assessing the correctness of solutions.

          The coding tasks included in this benchmark are sourced from open-access coding websites such as Codeforces and Kattis. These tasks span a range of difficulty levels, from introductory to collegiate competition level. The benchmark evaluates the accuracy of models in solving programming tasks specifically designed for coding competitions.

      papers_with_code_imagenet_top1_state_of_the_art:
        title: Top-1 accuracy - state of the art
        description: >
          The top-1 accuracy measure is used to assess how frequently a model's absolute top prediction matches the correct answer from a given set of options.  Here's an example to illustrate what this benchmark tests:


          Imagine an image classification model that is presented with an image of an animal. The model assigns probabilities to each potential label and generates its highest-confidence prediction. For instance, when analyzing an image, the model might predict "Cat" as the most probable label. To evaluate the model's accuracy using the top-1 measure, researchers compare this prediction with the correct label. If the model's top prediction matches the correct label (e.g., if the actual animal in the image is indeed a cat), then the model's prediction is considered correct according to the top-1 accuracy metric. On the other hand, if the model's top prediction does not match the correct label (e.g., if the image shows a dog, but the model predicts a cat), then the model's prediction is considered incorrect based on the top-1 accuracy measure. To calculate the top-1 accuracy, researchers analyze the model's performance on a large dataset where the correct labels are known. They determine the percentage of examples in the dataset where the model's highest-confidence prediction matches the actual label.


          This measure provides a focused evaluation of the model's ability to make accurate predictions by considering only its absolute top guess.

      papers_with_code_imagenet_top5_state_of_the_art:
        title: Top-5 accuracy - state of the art
        description: >
          The top-5 accuracy measure is used to assess how frequently a model's top five predictions include the correct answer from a list of 1000 options. Here's an example to illustrate what this benchmark tests:


          When an image classification model is presented with an image of an animal, it will assign probabilities to each possible label. Based on these probabilities, the model generates its top five predictions out of a total of 1000 animal labels. For instance, the model might output the following predictions as its top five guesses:
          * 		Cat
          * 		Dog
          * 		Elephant
          * 		Lion
          * 		Tiger


          Suppose the correct label for the image is "dog." If "dog" appears among the model's top five predictions, then the model's prediction is considered correct according to the top-5 accuracy metric.


          On the other hand, if the correct label is "giraffe" and "giraffe" is not included in the model's top five predictions, then the model's prediction would be considered incorrect based on the top-5 accuracy measure.


          To calculate the top-5 accuracy, researchers evaluate the model's performance on a large dataset with known labels. They compute the percentage of examples in the dataset where the correct label is present within the model's top five predictions out of the 1000 possible options. This measure provides a broader perspective on the model's performance by considering whether the correct answer is among its top guesses, even if it's not the model's absolute top prediction.

    Data from Lightcast which mined millions of job postings collected from over 51,000 websites since 2010 and flagged listings calling for AI skills (via AI Index (2023)). Includes percentage of all job
    postings that require some kind of AI skil across select countries.

    The AI Index is an independent initiative at the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.
    The mission of the AI Index is “to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, and globally sourced data for policymakers, researchers, executives, journalists, and the general public to develop intuitions about the complex field of AI.”
    Their flagship output is the annual AI Index Report, which has been published since 2017.

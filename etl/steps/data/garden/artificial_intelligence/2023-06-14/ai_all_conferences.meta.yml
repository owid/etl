  title: Attendance at Conferences (AI Index, 2023)
  description: &desc |
      Data from AI Index report on annual conference attendance. It should be interpreted with caution given that many conferences
      in the last few years have had virtual or hybrid formats. Conference organisers
      report that measuring the exact attendance numbers at virtual conferences is
      difficult, as virtual conferences allow for higher attendance of researchers
      from around the world.

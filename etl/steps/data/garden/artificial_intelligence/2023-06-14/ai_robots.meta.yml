  title: AI Industrial Robots
  description: >
      Annually, the IFR publishes the World Robotics Report, which provides comprehensive insights into global trends concerning robot installations.

      By monitoring the installation of industrial robots, which often incorporate AI-based software technologies, it becomes feasible to gather valuable information about the implementation of AI-ready infrastructure in real-world scenarios. This data is sourced from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), a nonprofit organization dedicated to the advancement and safeguarding of the robotics industry.

    To evaluate the impact of Copilot on productivity, well-being, and
    workflow, GitHub conducted a survey in 2022. Over 2,000 developers who were using
    Copilot participated in the survey. Additionally, GitHub recruited 95 developers
    and randomly split them into two groups, one of which used Copilot as part of
    a coding task and the other which did not.

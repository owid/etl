  title: GitHub Survey 2022 (AI Index, 2023)
  description: >-
    To evaluate the impact of Copilot on productivity, well-being, and workflow, GitHub conducted a survey in 2022. Over 2,000
    developers who were using Copilot participated in the survey. Additionally, GitHub recruited 95 developers and randomly
    split them into two groups, one of which used Copilot as part of a coding task and the other which did not.


    The AI Index is an independent initiative at the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.
    The mission of the AI Index is “to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, and globally sourced data for policymakers, researchers,
    executives, journalists, and the general public to develop intuitions about the complex field of AI.” Their flagship output
    is the annual AI Index Report, which has been published since 2017.

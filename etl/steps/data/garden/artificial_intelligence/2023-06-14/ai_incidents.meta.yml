    The AI, Algorithmic, and Automation Incidents and Controversies (AIAAIC)
    Repository is an independent, open, and public dataset of recent incidents and
    controversies driven by or relating to AI, algorithms, and automation. It was
    launched in 2019 as a private project to better understand some of the reputational
    risks of artificial intelligence and has evolved into a comprehensive initiative
    that tracks the ethical issues associated with AI technology. This dataset does
    not include AI incidents reported in 2022 yet, as the incidents submitted to the
    AIAAIC database undergo a lengthy vetting process before they are fully added.


    The AI Index is an independent initiative at the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.
    The mission of the AI Index is “to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, and globally sourced data for policymakers, researchers, executives, journalists, and the general public to develop intuitions about the complex field of AI.”
    Their flagship output is the annual AI Index Report, which has been published since 2017.

    The AI, Algorithmic, and Automation Incidents and Controversies (AIAAIC)
    Repository is an independent, open, and public dataset of recent incidents and
    controversies driven by or relating to AI, algorithms, and automation. It was
    launched in 2019 as a private project to better understand some of the reputational
    risks of artificial intelligence and has evolved into a comprehensive initiative
    that tracks the ethical issues associated with AI technology. This dataset does
    not include AI incidents reported in 2022 yet, as the incidents submitted to the
    AIAAIC database undergo a lengthy vetting process before they are fully added.

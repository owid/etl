      - Reporting a time series of AI investments in nominal prices would make it difficult to compare observations across time. To make these comparisons possible, one has to take into account that prices change (inflation).
      - It is not obvious how to adjust this time series for inflation, and our team discussed the best solutions at our disposal.
      - It would be straightforward to adjust the time series for price changes if we knew the prices of the specific goods and services purchased through these investments. This would make it possible to calculate a volume measure of AI investments and tell us how much these investments bought. But such a metric is not available. While a comprehensive price index is not available, we know that the cost of some crucial AI technology has fallen rapidly in price.
      - In the absence of a comprehensive price index that captures the price of AI-specific goods and services, one has to rely on one of the available metrics for the price of a bundle of goods and services. Ultimately, we decided to use the US Consumer Price Index (CPI).
      - The US CPI does not provide us with a volume measure of AI goods and services, but it does capture the opportunity costs of these investments. The inflation adjustment of this time series of AI investments, therefore, lets us understand the size of these investments relative to whatever else these sums of money could have purchased.

  description_short_investment: Only includes private-market investment such as venture capital; excludes all investment in publicly traded companies, such as "Big Tech" firms. This data is expressed in US dollars, adjusted for inflation.
  description_short_articles: English- and Chinese-language scholarly publications related to the development and application of AI. This includes journal articles, conference papers, repository publications (such as arXiv), books, and theses.
  description_short_patents: Patents related to artificial intelligence first submitted in the selected country's patent office. Subsequent granting of that patent could be by any country's patent office.

  description_short_citations: Citations take time to accumulate so recent years may have fewer citations, and the measure for these years may not completely reflective of their eventual total.

  note_citations: The citation counts for papers published in a specific year are subject to a time lag, as papers often accrue most citations in subsequent years. Data for 2022-2023 is therefore incomplete.
  note_articles:  Data for 2022-2023 is incomplete.
  note_investment: Data is expressed in constant 2021 US$. Inflation adjustment is based on the US Consumer Price Index (CPI). Data for 2022-2023 is incomplete.
  note_patents: According to calculations by CSET, the median time for a patent to be granted is 826 days from its initial filing date, while the average time is 860 days.  Data for 2021-2023 is incomplete.

  description_key_articles: &description_key_articles |-
    - CSET sources the data on the number of articles and citations from the Merged Academic Corpus (MAC), which includes over 260 million academic articles.
    - Articles are marked as AI-related using an automated system.
    - Articles are linked to countries based on the authors’ listed organizations—if at least one author is from an institution in a country, the article counts for that country.
    - If authors are from multiple countries, the article counts once for each country, but only once per country even if there are multiple authors from the same place.
    - For example, an article with authors from both the U.S. and Japan counts once for each.

  description_key_patents:  &description_key_patents |-
    - CSET sources patent data from 1790 Analytics, PATSTAT, and The Lens.
    - Patent data can be delayed, as some patent offices take years to release filings, so the most recent years may be incomplete and should be used with caution.
    - Here we've opted not to include the most recent years of data in the dataset, as they are likely to be incomplete as noted by the source.
    - The dataset includes over 360,000 AI-related patent families—groups of documents related to a single invention—and counts each family as one patent, treating it as a "granted patent" if any document in the family has been granted, or as a "patent application" if all documents are still pending.
    - Inventors often apply for the same patent in multiple countries, so the dataset groups all filings for one invention across jurisdictions into a single patent family, using the year and country of the first application to assign a filing date and location.
    - For example, if someone files a robot patent first in the European Patent Office and then in China, all documents are grouped under one EPO patent.
    - The dataset reports where patents are filed, not where inventors are from—for instance, many patents filed in the U.S. are by non-U.S. inventors—so filing location is used as a proxy for innovation and market interest.

    - The data likely underestimates total global AI investment, as it only captures certain types of private equity transactions, excluding other significant channels and categories of AI-related spending.
    - The dataset only covers private-market investment such as venture capital. It excludes non-equity financing, such as debt and grants, and publicly traded companies, including major Big Tech firms. As a result, significant investments from public companies, corporate R&D, government funding, and broader infrastructure costs (like data centers and hardware) are not captured, limiting the data's coverage of global AI investments.
    - The data's "World" aggregate reflects the total investment represented in the data, but may not represent global AI efforts comprehensively, especially in countries not included in the data.
    - Companies are classified as AI-related based on keyword and industry tags, potentially including firms not traditionally seen as AI-focused while missing others due to definitional differences.
    - Many investment values are undisclosed, so the source relies on median values from similar transactions, introducing some uncertainty. Additionally, investment origin is attributed to company headquarters, which may overlook cross-border structures or varied investor origins.
    - One-time events, such as large acquisitions, can distort yearly figures, while broader economic factors like interest rates and market sentiment can influence investment trends independently of AI-specific developments.

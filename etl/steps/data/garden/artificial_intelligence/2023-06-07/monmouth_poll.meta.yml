  description: &description-monmouth |
    The Monmouth University Poll was sponsored and conducted by the Monmouth
    University Polling Institute from January 26 to 30, 2023 with a probability-based
    national random sample of 805 adults age 18 and older. This includes 281 contacted
    by a live interviewer on a landline telephone and 524 contacted by a live interviewer
    on a cell phone, in English. Telephone numbers were selected through a mix of
    random digit dialing and list-based sampling. Landline respondents were selected
    with a modified Troldahl-Carter youngest adult household screen. Interviewing
    services were provided by Braun Research, with sample obtained from Dynata (RDD,
    n= 569), Aristotle (list, n= 152) and a panel of prior Monmouth poll participants
    (n= 84). Monmouth is responsible for all aspects of the survey design, data weighting
    and analysis. The full sample is weighted for region, age, education, gender and
    race based on US Census information (ACS 2021 one-year survey). For results based
    on this sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to
    sampling has a maximum margin of plus or minus 5.7 percentage points (adjusted
    for sample design effects). Sampling error can be larger for sub-groups (see table
    below). In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording
    and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into
    the findings of opinion polls.

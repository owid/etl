  title: Researcher Affiliation and Domain type in Notable AI Systems Data (Epoch, 2023)
  description: >
    The affiliation of the research team building a particular notable AI system was classified according to the following:

    — Academia: 100% of researchers affiliated with academia

    — Collaboration, Academia-majority: 71–99% affiliated with academia

    — Collaboration: 30–70% affiliated with academia

    — Collaboration, Industry-majority: 71–99% affiliated with industry

    — Industry: 100% of researchers affiliated with industry


    This data corresponds to the "Organization Categorization" and "Domain" columns in the primary source data spreadsheet.


    The authors selected the AI systems for inclusion based on the following necessary criteria:

    — Have an explicit learning component

    — Showcase experimental results

    — Advance the state of the art


    In addition, the systems had to meet at least one of the following notability criteria:

    — Paper has more than 1000 citations

    — Historical importance

    — Important state-of-the-art advance

    — Deployed in a notable context


    The authors note that: "For new models (from 2020 onward) it is harder to assess these criteria, so we fall back to a subjective selection. We refer to models meeting our selection criteria as 'milestone models.'"

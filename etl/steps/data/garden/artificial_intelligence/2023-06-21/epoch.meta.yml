  title: Parameter, Compute and Data Trends in Machine Learning (Epoch, 2023)
  description: &desc |
    We update this chart with the latest available data from our source every month.

    The authors selected the AI systems for inclusion based on the following necessary criteria:
    — Have an explicit learning component
    — Showcase experimental results
    — Advance the state of the art

    In addition, the systems had to meet at least one of the following notability criteria:
    — Paper has more than 1000 citations
    — Historical importance
    — Important state-of-the-art advance
    — Deployed in a notable context

    The authors note that: "For new models (from 2020 onward) it is harder to assess these criteria, so we fall back to a subjective selection. We refer to models meeting our selection criteria as 'milestone models.'"

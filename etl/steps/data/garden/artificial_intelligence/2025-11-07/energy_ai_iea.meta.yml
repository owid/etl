    - The Base Case looks at how electricity use in data centres is expected to change if today’s regulations stay the same and the industry develops as currently projected.
    - In the short term, the main factor shaping this outlook is industry forecasts for server shipments up to 2028, with similar trends assumed to continue beyond that point.
    - Improvements in energy efficiency are expected to play a key role in keeping electricity use from rising too quickly, even as demand for digital services continues to grow.
  data_centers_description: &data_centers_description
    - Data centers house the servers and computing infrastructure that power internet services, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence applications.
    - This metric includes electricity consumption for all data center operations, encompassing both conventional servers and accelerated servers used for AI and machine learning workloads.

        description_short: Data center electricity consumption as a percentage of total global or regional electricity demand.
        description_key:
          - This metric shows the proportion of total electricity demand that is consumed by data centers.
          - *data_centers_description
        description_processing: We calculated this share by dividing data centre electricity consumption by total electricity demand for each country or region.

      total_electricity_consumption__twh__historical:
        title: Total electricity consumption by data centers
        unit: terawatt-hours
        short_unit: TWh
        description_short: Electricity consumption by data centers, including both traditional and AI workloads.
        description_key:
          - Data centers house the servers and computing infrastructure that power internet services, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence applications.
          - This metric includes electricity consumption for all data center operations, encompassing both conventional servers and accelerated servers used for AI and machine learning workloads.
          - Data reflects actual recorded energy consumption from 2020 to 2024.

      total_installed_capacity__gw__historical:
        title: Total installed capacity for data centers
        unit: gigawatts
        short_unit: GW
        description_short: Total installed power capacity of data centers worldwide and by region.
        description_key:
          - Installed capacity represents the maximum power that data center infrastructure can draw from the electrical grid.
          - This includes capacity for servers, cooling systems, and supporting infrastructure required to operate data centers.
          - Data covers the period from 2020 to 2024.

      total_electricity_consumption__share_of_total_electricity_demand__historical:
        title: Share of total electricity demand consumed by data centers
        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
        description_short: Data center electricity consumption as a percentage of total global or regional electricity demand.
        description_key:
          - This metric shows the proportion of total electricity demand that is consumed by data centers.
          - The share has been growing as digital services, cloud computing, and AI applications have expanded globally.
          - Calculated by dividing data center electricity consumption by total electricity demand for each country or region.

        title: Projected total installed capacity for data centers
        unit: gigawatts
        short_unit: GW
        description_short: Projected total installed power capacity of data centers in 2030 under the IEA's base scenario.
        description_key:
          - The base scenario represents the IEA's central projection for data center capacity growth to 2030, accounting for expected AI adoption and digital service expansion.
          - This scenario assumes data center electricity consumption grows by approximately 15% annually from 2024 to 2030, more than four times faster than growth in other sectors.
          - Projections account for improvements in energy efficiency while anticipating rapid growth in AI-related computing demand, particularly in accelerated servers.

      total_electricity_consumption__twh__base:
        title: Projected total electricity consumption by data centers
        unit: terawatt-hours
        short_unit: TWh
        description_short: Projected electricity consumption by data centers in 2030 under the IEA's base scenario.
        description_key:
          - The base scenario projects global data center electricity consumption will reach approximately 945 TWh by 2030, nearly double the 2024 level.
          - This growth is primarily driven by AI adoption, with accelerated server consumption growing at 30% annually compared to 9% for conventional servers.
          - By 2030, data centers are projected to account for just under 3% of total global electricity consumption in this scenario.
          - China and the United States are expected to drive nearly 80% of global growth, with consumption increasing by around 240 TWh in the US and 175 TWh in China from 2024 to 2030.

    - The Base Case looks at how electricity use in data centres is expected to change if today’s regulations stay the same and the industry develops as currently projected.
    - In the short term, the main factor shaping this outlook is industry forecasts for server shipments up to 2028, with similar trends assumed to continue beyond that point.
    - Improvements in energy efficiency are expected to play a key role in keeping electricity use from rising too quickly, even as demand for digital services continues to grow.
  data_centers_description: &data_centers_description
    - It covers total data-center electricity use (including cooling and other support systems), across both general-purpose and AI-specialized servers.

        processing_level: major
        description_short: Data center electricity consumption as a share of total electricity demand of the country or region. Data centers power a wide range of online services beyond AI, such as streaming services and cloud storage. The data does not allow a separate estimate for AI use.
        description_key:
          - This indicator shows what share of a country’s or region’s total electricity demand comes from data centers.
          - *data_centers_description
        description_processing: We calculated this share by dividing data centre electricity consumption by total electricity demand for each country or region.

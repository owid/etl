        title: Top-1 accuracy
        description_key:
          - The top-1 accuracy measure is used to assess how frequently a model's absolute top prediction matches the correct answer from a given set of options.
          - "Here's an example to illustrate what this benchmark tests: Imagine an image classification model that is presented with an image of an animal. The model assigns probabilities to each potential label and generates its highest-confidence prediction. For instance, when analyzing an image, the model might predict 'Cat' as the most probable label. To evaluate the model's accuracy using the top-1 measure, researchers compare this prediction with the correct label. If the model's top prediction matches the correct label (e.g., if the actual animal in the image is indeed a cat), then the model's prediction is considered correct according to the top-1 accuracy metric. On the other hand, if the model's top prediction does not match the correct label (e.g., if the image shows a dog, but the model predicts a cat), then the model's prediction is considered incorrect based on the top-1 accuracy measure. To calculate the top-1 accuracy, researchers analyze the model's performance on a large dataset where the correct labels are known. They determine the percentage of examples in the dataset where the model's highest-confidence prediction matches the actual label."
          - This measure provides a focused evaluation of the model's ability to make accurate predictions by considering only its absolute top guess.

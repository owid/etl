        title: Semiconductor billings (three-month moving average)
        unit: US$
        short_unit: $
        description_short: Three-month moving average of semiconductor industry billing data in US dollars.
        description_key:
          - The 3-month moving average smooths out short-term fluctuations in monthly billing data.
          - This metric helps identify underlying trends in the semiconductor market.
          - Moving averages are particularly useful for analyzing cyclical industries like semiconductors.

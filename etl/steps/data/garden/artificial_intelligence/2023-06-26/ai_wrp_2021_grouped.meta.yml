  title: World Risk Poll - AI questions, grouped by gender, income, education, age and region (2021)
  description: >-
    Spread across four themed reports, the 2021 World Risk Poll covers the biggest risks facing people and communities globally,
    ranging from road crashes, severe weather, climate change and disaster resilience, to work-related harm, violence and
    harassment at work, and use of personal data. It will be repeated at least two more times, in 2023 and 2025.


    This data includes aggregates of survey responses to the following two questions:


    1) Will artificial intelligence help or harm people in the next 20 years?


    2) Would you feel safe in a car driven by computer without a human driver?

          Mask aligners line up a patterned glass plate called a photomask with a silicon wafer that has been coated in light-sensitive phtoresist. This category includes contact aligners (which press the mask directly against a wafer), proximity aligners (which leave a small gap between the mask and the wafer), and scanning projection aligners (which use high-quality optics to project the mask image onto the wafer without physical contact). German firm SUSS MicroTec is the leading supplier of mask aligners.

          Electron-beam (or \"e-beam\") lithography tools draw patterns in a substrate using electrons. They are the dominant tools for photomask production, and are also infrequently used for low-volume chip production. Like other maskless lithography tools, e-beam tools can quickly and cheaply make new patterns, but are slow at drawing patterns into wafers, making them ill-suited to mass chip production.
          <% elif provided_name == "Mask exposure systems - laser beam" %>
          Laser lithography tools draw patterns in a substrate using laser light. They are sometimes used to produce photomasks (though less often than e-beam tools). Like other maskless lithography tools, laser lithography tools can quickly and cheaply make new patterns, but are slow at drawing patterns into wafers, making them ill-suited to mass chip production.
          <% elif provided_name == "Maskless lithography tools" %>
          Maskless lithography equipment draws patterns in a substrate using laser light, electrons, or ions. Unlike photolithography equipment, maskless lithography tools work without masks. This allows them to quickly and cheaply make new patterns, but slows down the process of drawing patterns into the wafer. As a result, maskless lithography tools can cost-effectively produce low-volume items like photomasks, but are are ill-suited to mass chip production.

          <% elif provided_name == "Packaging materials" %>
          Semiconductor packaging involves several steps to bond a fabricated chip to an encasing package, each requiring different materials. For example, a bond wire, typically made of aluminum, copper, silver, or gold, attaches the chip to a lead frame. The lead frame transfers data between the chip and external devices. A protective ceramic package, plastic substrate, or encapsulant resin can also be bonded to the chip.  Die attach materials including polymers and eutectic alloys are used to attach the chip to packages or substrates.

          <% elif provided_name == "Photolithography" %>
          In photolithography, light is used to draw patterns into semiconductor wafers, creating the tiny circuits that comprise logic chips. A photolithography tool passes light through a photomask-a transparent plate with a circuit pattern-to transfer that pattern to a wafer coated with photoresist chemical. (Photomasks are themselves made with lithography tools.) The light dissolves parts of the photoresist according to the circuit pattern.  Advanced photolithography is critical to mass production of cutting-edge semiconductors. It requires enormously complex, expensive equipment supplied by only a few vendors in Europe and Japan. The most sophisticated photolithography processes involve extreme ultraviolet (EUV) scanners, produced exclusively by the Dutch firm ASML. This is part of the Fabrication stage.

          Photomasks are transparent plates containing a circuit pattern to be fabricated in a chip. Photolithography equipment produces light that passes through this pattern so that the photomask's pattern is transferred to the chip.  Each photomask is specific to one chip design. Photomasks are produced by captive mask shops (businesses within large semiconductor manufacturing firms) or merchant mask shops (which sell to semiconductor manufacturers). Japan, the United States, and Taiwan lead production of leading-edge photomasks.
          <% elif provided_name == "Photoresists" %>
          Photoresists are chemicals deposited on a wafer. When exposed to patterned light that has passed through a photomask, they selectively dissolve to form the circuit pattern. Etching is then performed in places where the photoresist has dissolved to transfer the circuit pattern permanently onto the wafer. Photoresists are specific to particular photolithography processes. Japanese firms are the leading producers.
          <% elif provided_name == "Physical vapor deposition tools" %>

          <% elif provided_name == "Wafer" %>
          Silicon wafers are the basic building block for chip production. To produce them, a furnace forms a cylinder of silicon (or other semiconducting materials), which is then cut into disc-shaped wafers. These wafers are then processed, split and packaged into individual chips. Most wafers are made purely of silicon or another material, but others have more complex structures.  Dopants, such as boron, aluminum, phosphorous, platinum or other elements, may be added to alter the level of semiconductivity.  300 mm wafers, produced by Japanese, Taiwanese, German, and Korean firms, are used to produce nearly all advanced chips today. Manufacturing the smoothest, high-purity 300 mm wafers-which are necessary for supporting the smallest chip feature sizes-requires considerable tacit know-how. Older-technology wafer sizes include 150 and 200 mm, used for chips with larger feature sizes.

          Etching and cleaning tools have two main types: dry and wet. Wet etching tools, using liquids, are less commonly used, and largely for cleaning wafers. Wet etching has advantages compared to dry etching-it is cheaper, risks less damage to substrates, and is more selective, i.e., it can etch a particular material without unintentionally etching nearby materials. However, it is slower and typically cannot etch differently depending on the direction of etch, making it difficult to form complex structures. Therefore, wet etching is not typically used for etching the smallest features in advanced chips.

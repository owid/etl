      manufacturer:
        title: Manufacturer
        unit: ''
        short_unit: ''
        description_short: The company that produced the GPU.

      fp32__single_precision__performance__flop_s:
        title: FP32 performance
        unit: FLOP/s
        description_short: The number of floating-point operations per second that can be performed by the GPU. FLOP/s values refer to 32-bit (full) precision.

        title: Release price
        unit: US$
        short_unit: $
        description_short: The price of the GPU at the time of its release.
        description_from_producer: Whenever available, the producer uses the release price of the hardware, adjust it for inflation and assume a two-year amortization time as detailed in Cotra (2020).

      comp_performance_per_dollar:
        title: GPU computational performance per dollar
        unit: FLOP/s/$
        description_short: The number of floating-point operations per second that can be performed for every US dollar spent on the GPU.

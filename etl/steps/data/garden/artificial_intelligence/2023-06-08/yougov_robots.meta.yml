  description: &desc >
    Biannual tracker of Americans' concerns regarding robotic intelligence. Next update is in January. The provided results are
    weighted to ensure they are representative of the United States population across various demographic factors. The weighting

    weighting process helps to account for the diversity within the population and ensures that the results reflect a broader
    representation of the United States as a whole. Each wave comprises responses from 1004 - 1085 US Adults.

    - Most robots have already developed higher levels of intelligence than humans


    - None of these


    - Robots will be able to develop higher levels of intelligence than humans in the future

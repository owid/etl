    CAT, or Country Attributes and Topics, is a research tool curated by CSET that offers a wealth of data about artificial
    intelligence (AI) globally. This data comes from a vast repository known as the Merged Academic Corpus (MAC), which contains
    details about more than 270 million academic articles worldwide. In CAT, only those articles that are related to AI are
    utilized.


    CSET determines the country of origin for each article by looking at the affiliations of the authors. If an author is
    associated with an organization in a specific country, that article is attributed to that country. These articles are
    then grouped into various AI sub-categories. This categorization is based on a scoring system that assigns scores to each
    article according to its subject. However, this scoring system only applies to English-language articles. For non-English
    articles, scores are estimated based on the average scores of articles they either cite or are cited by.


    CAT also provides patent data sourced from 1790 Analytics and Dimensions, encompassing AI-related patents. However, instead
    of indicating patent ownership, CAT highlights where the patents are filed. For instance, a patent filed in the U.S. patent
    office is not necessarily owned by an American. CSET is striving to include data regarding the nationality of patent owners
    in future updates of CAT.


    Additionally, CAT uses data from Crunchbase to identify AI-related companies and includes metrics about investments in
    these companies. The definition of an 'AI company' is not straightforward, but CSET identifies such companies based on
    specific criteria. These include whether the company description contains AI-related keywords, whether Crunchbase tags
    it as an AI company, or if it is linked with an AI Publication, AI Patent, or a Top AI Conference Publication as per CSET's
    Private-sector AI-Related Activity Tracker. CSET aims to encompass a broad range of AI-related companies across the globe.
    Therefore, some companies may be categorized as AI-related that others may not consider as such. Conversely, some companies
    perceived as AI-related by others may not meet the criteria set by CSET.


    CSET ensures the data in CAT is updated at least quarterly, with plans to provide more frequent updates in the future.

          - Games systems are specifically designed to play games. They use advanced algorithms to understand and strategize, often competing effectively against humans or other AI systems.

          - Language systems are tailored to process language, focusing on understanding, translating, and interacting with human languages.

          - Multimodal systems excel at processing multiple types of data at once, like sound and visuals together.

          - Not specified category captures systems where their primary function isn't clearly defined.

          - Other category represents a diverse set, including tasks from 3D reconstruction to speech processing and video analysis.

          - Vision systems focus on processing visual information, playing a pivotal role in image recognition and related areas.

          - Speech systems are dedicated to handling spoken language, being the backbone of voice assistants and similar applications.

          - Recommendation systems offer suggestions based on user preferences, seen prominently in online shopping and media streaming.

          - Drawing systems can create illustrations or sketches, either mimicking human techniques or generating unique art.

          Processing involved calculating total number of AI systems in each domain for each year.

          To streamline the categorization of domains, 3D reconstruction, Driving, Drawing, Recommendation, Speech, Video, Text-to-Video, Search, Audio and Robotics were all unified under a single "Other" category.

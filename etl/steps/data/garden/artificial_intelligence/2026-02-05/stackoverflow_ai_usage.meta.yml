    description_key:
      - This indicator shows how professional developers responded to a question about AI tool usage in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, conducted annually since 2023.
      - Respondents are self-selected professional developers who chose to participate in the survey. Results may not be representative of all developers worldwide.
      - In 2025, Stack Overflow changed the question to ask about usage frequency (daily, weekly, or monthly/infrequently) rather than a simple yes/no. A collapsed "Yes" value is included for cross-year comparability.
      - The number of respondents per year ranges from {response_range}.

        description_key:
          - This indicator shows how professional developers responded to a question about AI tool usage in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, conducted annually since 2023.
          - Respondents are self-selected professional developers who chose to participate in the survey. Results may not be representative of all developers worldwide.
          - In 2025, Stack Overflow changed the question to ask about usage frequency (daily, weekly, or monthly/infrequently) rather than a simple yes/no. A collapsed "Yes" row is included for cross-year comparability.
          - The granular 2025 frequency rows ("Yes, daily", "Yes, weekly", "Yes, monthly or infrequently") are also included for those interested in usage intensity.
          - The number of respondendents per year ranges from {response_range}.

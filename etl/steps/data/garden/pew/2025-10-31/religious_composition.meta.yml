      Estimates are based on more than 2,700 censuses and surveys. You can read complete methodology in [Pew's report](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2025/06/09/how-the-global-religious-landscape-changed-from-2010-to-2020/).
    other_religions: |-

          - In most countries, it is not possible to precisely count the number of people who identify with each religion. Because our estimates are not precise, the tables in this report and accompanying data files show rounded population counts (often to the nearest 10,000) and show counts below 10,000 as “<10,000.”

          {tables.religious_composition.variables.count.description_short}
           These estimates are unrounded counts, which should be used with caution.

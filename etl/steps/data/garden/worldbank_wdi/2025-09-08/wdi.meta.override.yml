  gdp: Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the total value added from the production of goods and services in a country or region each year.
  gdp_per_capita: GDP per capita is GDP divided by population.
  gni: Gross national income (GNI) is a measure of the total income earned by residents of a country or region each year. It is calculated as GDP plus net income received from abroad, plus taxes (minus subsidies) on production.
  gni_per_capita: GNI per capita is GNI divided by population.
  ppp_adjustment: This data is adjusted for inflation and differences in living costs between countries.
  ppp_prices: This data is expressed in [international-$](#dod:int_dollar_abbreviation) at 2021 prices.
  inflation_adjustment: This data is adjusted by inflation but _does not_ account for differences in living costs between countries.
  inflation_prices: This data is expressed in constant 2015 US$.

  description_short_gdp: Total economic output of a country or region per year.
  description_short_gdp_per_capita: Average economic output per person in a country or region per year.
  description_short_gni: Total income earned by residents of a country or region, including income earned abroad.
  description_short_gni_per_capita: Average income per person earned by residents of a country or region, including income earned abroad.

  # description_key_gdp_introduction: "[Gross domestic product](#dod:gdp) (GDP) is a comprehensive measure of countries' total income. It helps compare income levels across countries and track how they change over time. It is especially useful for understanding trends in economic growth and living standards."
  description_key_gdp_definition: "[Gross domestic product](#dod:gdp) (GDP) is calculated as the value of all final goods and services produced each year in a country. It represents the total economic output of a country or region."
  description_key_gdp_mention_mpd: This data comes from the World Bank and starts in 1990. For estimates going back several centuries, explore our chart of GDP from the [Maddison Project Database](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-maddison-project-database).

  description_key_gdp_per_capita_introduction: GDP per capita is a comprehensive measure of people's average income. It helps compare income levels across countries and track how they change over time. It is especially useful for understanding trends in economic growth and living standards.
  description_key_gdp_per_capita_definition: GDP per capita is calculated as the value of all final goods and services produced each year in a country (the [gross domestic product](#dod:gdp)), divided by the population. It represents the average economic output per person.
  description_key_gdp_per_capita_inequality: This indicator shows the large inequality between people in different countries. In the poorest countries, average incomes are below $1,000 per year; in rich countries, they are more than 50 times higher.

  subtitle_gdp_per_capita: GDP per capita is a country's [gross domestic product](#dod:gdp) divided by its population.

  description_processing_gdp_constant: |-
    We constructed estimates of GDP and GDP per capita in constant 2021 US$ by taking the corresponding series in current US$ and applying them the growth rates of the series in constant local currency units, adjusted by the base year (2021). This is [the same methodology](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/114943-how-do-you-derive-constant-price-series-in-usd) followed by the World Bank to obtain the series in constant 2015 US$.

    We obtain this indicator to have a more meaningful comparison between exchange-rate-based and PPP-based GDP estimates in the same reference year.

    We have also obtained [Our World in Data regional aggregations](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions) of these indicators by calculating a population-weighted average by region. You can see more information about the population data in [this dedicated article about sources](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources).

  desc_key_ger: &desc_key_ger
    - The gross enrolment ratio counts all students enrolled at a specific education level, regardless of their age. This includes students who are younger or older than the official age range because they started school early, started late, or repeated grades.
    - It measures enrolment at a given level by dividing the total number of students—of any age—by the size of the age group officially assigned to that level. For instance, primary enrolment counts everyone enrolled, even outside ages 6–11, but compares it only to the 6–11 population.
    - Values can exceed 100% when students repeat grades or start late. For instance, primary school enrolment might include 12- or 13-year-olds who started late or repeated grades, pushing the ratio above 100%.
    - A value of 100% does not guarantee that all children in the official age group are enrolled in school; some may be out of school entirely, but the ratio appears high due to older students being counted in the total.
    - Values much lower than 100% indicate that many children of the official age are not enrolled at the expected education level - they may be out of school entirely, enrolled at a different level, or have never started school.
    - Values much higher than 100% can indicate educational challenges such as high grade repetition rates, late school entry, or inefficient progression through the system.
    - The data comes from administrative records such as school enrolment reports, combined with population estimates typically sourced from the United Nations or national statistical offices.

  desc_key_trained_teachers: &desc_key_trained_teachers
   - Not all teachers receive the same level of preparation before entering the classroom. This indicator measures the percentage of teachers at each education level who have completed at least the minimum organized pedagogical training required for teaching at that level in their country.
   - It captures the share of teachers who are pedagogically trained, expressed as a percentage of all teachers at that level. For example, if there are 1,000 primary teachers and 850 have completed the required training, the indicator shows 85%.
   - The "minimum training" refers to whatever organized pedagogical preparation each country requires — pre-service teacher education programs, in-service training courses, or certification requirements that focus on teaching methods rather than subject knowledge.
   - Values below 100% suggest some teachers are working without the pedagogical training their own country considers necessary. However, cross-country comparisons can be misleading since training requirements vary significantly between nations.
   - This indicator does not account for differences in teachers' experience, professional status, teaching methods, materials, or classroom conditions — all of which affect the quality of teaching and learning. Some teachers without formal training may also acquire equivalent skills through professional experience.
   - The reference years reflect the school year. In countries where the school year spans two calendar years (e.g. September 2010 to June 2011), the reference year is the year in which the school year ended (2011 in this example).
   - The data comes from administrative records collected at schools and other organized learning centers, typically including information on teacher academic credentials and employment status.

  description_short_clean_fuels: &description_short_clean_fuels |-
    Access to [clean fuels or technologies](#dod:clean-cooking-fuels) such as natural gas, electricity, and clean cookstoves reduces exposure to indoor air pollutants, a leading cause of death in low-income households.
  description_from_producer_clean_fuels: &description_from_producer_clean_fuels |-
    Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking is the proportion of total population primarily using clean cooking fuels and technologies for cooking. Under WHO guidelines, kerosene is excluded from clean cooking fuels.

    Statistical concept and methodology: Data for access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking are based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Household Energy Database. They are collected among different sources: only data from nationally representative household surveys (including national censuses) were used. Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed and implemented surveys, and various government agencies (for example, ministries of energy and utilities).

    Trends in the proportion of the population using each fuel type are estimated using a single multivariate hierarchical model, with urban and rural disaggregation. Estimates for overall "polluting" fuels (unprocessed biomass, charcoal, coal, and kerosene) and "clean" fuels (gaseous fuels, electricity, as well as an aggregation of any other clean fuels like alcohol) are produced by aggregating estimates of relevant fuel types. The model was used to derive clean fuel use estimates for 191 countries (ref. Stoner, O., Shaddick, G., Economou, T., Gumy, S., Lewis, J., Lucio, I., Ruggeri, G. and Adair-Rohani, H. (2020), Global household energy model: a multivariate hierarchical approach to estimating trends in the use of polluting and clean fuels for cooking. J. R. Stat. Soc. C, 69: 815-839). Countries classified by the World Bank as high income (57 countries) in the 2022 fiscal year are assumed to have universal access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.
  description_short_electricity: &description_short_electricity |-
    Access to electricity means having an electricity source that can provide very basic lighting, and charge a phone or power a radio for 4 hours per day.

          - A value below one means local goods and services are cheaper than in the US, while a value above one suggests local prices are higher.
          - These comparisons are based on PPP conversion rates (also called PPP conversion factors or PPP rates). PPP rates estimate how many units of a country’s local currency are needed to buy (roughly) the same basket of goods and services in that country that one US dollar would buy in the United States. For this indicator (at the level of [GDP](#dod:gdp)), the comparison is made using a broad, economy-wide basket of goods and services.
          - PPP rates are calculated by the [International Comparison Program (ICP)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp), which uses the United States as a benchmark country.

        title: Individuals using the Internet (% of population)
        description_short: Share of the population who used the Internet in the last three months.
        description_from_producer: >-
          Internet users are individuals who have used the Internet (from any location)
          in the last 3 months. The Internet can be used via a computer, mobile phone,
          personal digital assistant, games machine, digital TV etc.

          Limitations and exceptions: Operators have traditionally been the main source
          of telecommunications data, so information on subscriptions has been widely
          available for most countries. This gives a general idea of access, but a more
          precise measure is the penetration rate - the share of households with access
          to telecommunications. During the past few years more information on
          information and communication technology use has become available from
          household and business surveys. Also important are data on actual use of
          telecommunications services. Ideally, statistics on telecommunications (and
          other information and communications technologies) should be compiled for all
          three measures: subscriptions, access, and use. The quality of data varies
          among reporting countries as a result of differences in regulations covering
          data provision and availability.

          Discrepancies may also arise in cases where the end of a fiscal year differs
          from that used by ITU, which is the end of December of every year. A number of
          countries have fiscal years that end in March or June of every
          year.

          Statistical concept and methodology: The Internet is a world-wide public
          computer network. It provides access to a number of communication services
          including the World Wide Web and carries email, news, entertainment and data
          files, irrespective of the device used (not assumed to be only via a computer -
          it may also be by mobile phone, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access
          can be via a fixed or mobile network. For additional/latest information on
          sources and country notes, please also refer to:

        description_from_producer: |-
          Prevalence of stunting is the percentage of children under age 5 whose height for age is more than two standard deviations below the median for the international reference population ages 0-59 months. For children up to two years old height is measured by recumbent length. For older children height is measured by stature while standing. The data are based on the WHO's new child growth standards released in 2006.

          - "Access to electricity improves people's living conditions in many ways. [Light at night](https://ourworldindata.org/light-at-night) makes it possible to get together after sunset; mobile phones allow us to stay in touch with those far away; refrigeration reduces food waste; and household appliances free up time from chores."
          - This data captures whether people have access to the most basic electricity supply — just enough to provide basic lighting and charge a phone or power a radio for 4 hours per day.
          - It shows that, especially in several African countries, a large share of the population lacks the benefits of basic electricity.
          - Universal access to electricity by 2030 is one of the United Nations [Sustainable Development Goals](https://ourworldindata.org/sdgs/affordable-clean-energy#sdg-indicator-7-1-1-access-to-electricity).
          - "This data comes from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. Estimates are based on national household surveys, census data, and reports from energy providers or government agencies. Where data is missing, values are estimated by the source using a model based on trends across countries, regions, and time. Countries classified as “developed” by the United Nations are assumed to have universal access."

        description_from_producer: |-
          Prevalence of undernourishments is the percentage of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal active and healthy life. Data showing as 2.5 may signify a prevalence of undernourishment below 2.5%.

          Limitations and exceptions: From a policy and program standpoint, this measure has its limits. First, food insecurity exists even where food availability is not a problem because of inadequate access of poor households to food. Second, food insecurity is an individual or household phenomenon, and the average food available to each person, even corrected for possible effects of low income, is not a good predictor of food insecurity among the population. And third, nutrition security is determined not only by food security but also by the quality of care of mothers and children and the quality of the household's health environment (Smith and Haddad 2000).

          Statistical concept and methodology: Data on undernourishment are from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and measure food deprivation based on average food available for human consumption per person, the level of inequality in access to food, and the minimum calories required for an average person.

          Patent applications are worldwide patent applications filed through the Patent Cooperation Treaty procedure or with a national patent office for exclusive rights for an invention--a product or process that provides a new way of doing something or offers a new technical solution to a problem. A patent provides protection for the invention to the owner of the patent for a limited period, generally 20 years.

          Resident patent applications are those for which the first-named applicant or assignee is a resident of the State or region concerned. In the case of regional offices such as the European Patent Office, a resident is an applicant from any of the member States of the regional patent convention. Patent data cover applications and grants classified by field of technology. International applications series distinguish four subcategories: a) patents taken out by residents of a country in that country; b) patents taken out in a country by non-residents of that country; c) total patents registered in the country or naming it; d) patents taken out outside a country by its residents. Data on patents granted only distinguish between patents awarded to residents and to non-residents.

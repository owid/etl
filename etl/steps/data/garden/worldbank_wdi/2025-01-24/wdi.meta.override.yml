        title: Individuals using the Internet (% of population)
        description_short: Share of the population who used the Internet in the last three months.
        description_from_producer: >-
          Internet users are individuals who have used the Internet (from any location)
          in the last 3 months. The Internet can be used via a computer, mobile phone,
          personal digital assistant, games machine, digital TV etc.

          Limitations and exceptions: Operators have traditionally been the main source
          of telecommunications data, so information on subscriptions has been widely
          available for most countries. This gives a general idea of access, but a more
          precise measure is the penetration rate - the share of households with access
          to telecommunications. During the past few years more information on
          information and communication technology use has become available from
          household and business surveys. Also important are data on actual use of
          telecommunications services. Ideally, statistics on telecommunications (and
          other information and communications technologies) should be compiled for all
          three measures: subscriptions, access, and use. The quality of data varies
          among reporting countries as a result of differences in regulations covering
          data provision and availability.

          Discrepancies may also arise in cases where the end of a fiscal year differs
          from that used by ITU, which is the end of December of every year. A number of
          countries have fiscal years that end in March or June of every
          year.

          Statistical concept and methodology: The Internet is a world-wide public
          computer network. It provides access to a number of communication services
          including the World Wide Web and carries email, news, entertainment and data
          files, irrespective of the device used (not assumed to be only via a computer -
          it may also be by mobile phone, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access
          can be via a fixed or mobile network. For additional/latest information on
          sources and country notes, please also refer to:

        description_from_producer: |-
          Prevalence of stunting is the percentage of children under age 5 whose height for age is more than two standard deviations below the median for the international reference population ages 0-59 months. For children up to two years old height is measured by recumbent length. For older children height is measured by stature while standing. The data are based on the WHO's new child growth standards released in 2006.

          Access to [clean fuels or technologies](#dod:clean-cooking-fuels) such as natural gas, electricity, and clean cookstoves reduces exposure to indoor air pollutants, a leading cause of death in low-income households.
        description_from_producer: |-
          Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking is the proportion of total population primarily using clean cooking fuels and technologies for cooking. Under WHO guidelines, kerosene is excluded from clean cooking fuels.

          Statistical concept and methodology: Data for access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking are based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Household Energy Database. They are collected among different sources: only data from nationally representative household surveys (including national censuses) were used. Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed and implemented surveys, and various government agencies (for example, ministries of energy and utilities).

          Trends in the proportion of the population using each fuel type are estimated using a single multivariate hierarchical model, with urban and rural disaggregation. Estimates for overall "polluting" fuels (unprocessed biomass, charcoal, coal, and kerosene) and "clean" fuels (gaseous fuels, electricity, as well as an aggregation of any other clean fuels like alcohol) are produced by aggregating estimates of relevant fuel types. The model was used to derive clean fuel use estimates for 191 countries (ref. Stoner, O., Shaddick, G., Economou, T., Gumy, S., Lewis, J., Lucio, I., Ruggeri, G. and Adair-Rohani, H. (2020), Global household energy model: a multivariate hierarchical approach to estimating trends in the use of polluting and clean fuels for cooking. J. R. Stat. Soc. C, 69: 815-839). Countries classified by the World Bank as high income (57 countries) in the 2022 fiscal year are assumed to have universal access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking.

          Electrification data are collected from industry, national surveys and international sources.

          Statistical concept and methodology: Data for access to electricity are collected among different sources: mostly data from nationally representative household surveys (including national censuses) were used. Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), other nationally developed and implemented surveys, and various government agencies (for example, ministries of energy and utilities). Given the low frequency and the regional distribution of some surveys, a number of countries have gaps in available data.

          To develop the historical evolution and starting point of electrification rates, a simple modeling approach was adopted to fill in the missing data points - around 1990, around 2000, and around 2010. Therefore, a country can have a continuum of zero to three data points. There are 42 countries with zero data point and the weighted regional average was used as an estimate for electrification in each of the data periods. 170 countries have between one and three data points and missing data are estimated by using a model with region, country, and time variables. The model keeps the original observation if data is available for any of the time periods. This modeling approach allowed the estimation of electrification rates for 212 countries over these three time periods (Indicated as \"Estimate\"). Notation \"Assumption\" refers to the assumption of universal access in countries classified as developed by the United Nations. Data begins from the year in which the first survey data is available for each country.

        description_from_producer: |-
          Prevalence of undernourishments is the percentage of the population whose habitual food consumption is insufficient to provide the dietary energy levels that are required to maintain a normal active and healthy life. Data showing as 2.5 may signify a prevalence of undernourishment below 2.5%.

          Limitations and exceptions: From a policy and program standpoint, this measure has its limits. First, food insecurity exists even where food availability is not a problem because of inadequate access of poor households to food. Second, food insecurity is an individual or household phenomenon, and the average food available to each person, even corrected for possible effects of low income, is not a good predictor of food insecurity among the population. And third, nutrition security is determined not only by food security but also by the quality of care of mothers and children and the quality of the household's health environment (Smith and Haddad 2000).

          Statistical concept and methodology: Data on undernourishment are from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and measure food deprivation based on average food available for human consumption per person, the level of inequality in access to food, and the minimum calories required for an average person.

        title: Female labor force participation rate
        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
        description_short: Share of the female working-age population (ages 15 and over) who are economically active (employed or unemployed).
        description_key:
          - The labor force participation rate shows the share of working-age people who are either employed (working for pay or profit) or unemployed (not working, but actively looking for work and available to start). This indicator shows the share of the population that is economically active.
          - People who are not seeking work or are not available, such as students, retired people, or unpaid caregivers, are excluded as they are considered to be outside the labor force.
          - This series combines data from [Long (1958)](https://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/nbrnberbk/long58-1.htm) with official statistics from each country, and the International Labour Organization's Yearbook of Labour Statistics.
          - For several observations before 1960, the working age population is age 14 or older, instead of 15 or older. In Great Britain, it is age 12 or older in the year 1921.
          - Data for the United Kingdom represents Great Britain (excludes Northern Ireland). Germany is represented by post-WWI until 1925, and by West Germany (without Berlin) from 1939 onwards.
        processing_level: major
        description_processing: The data for Germany had two values for 1939, one with post WWI borders and one with West Germany borders (without Berlin). We kept the latter, which follows the convention of the rest of the dataset.

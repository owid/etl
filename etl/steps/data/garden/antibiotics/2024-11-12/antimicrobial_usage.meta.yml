    Access antibiotics have activity against a wide range of common pathogens and show lower resistance potential than antibiotics in the other groups.

    Watch antibiotic have higher resistance potential and include most of the highest priority agents among the Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine and/or antibiotics that are at relatively high risk of bacterial resistance.
    <% elif aware == "R" %>
    Reserve antibiotics  should be reserved for treatment of confirmed or suspected infections due to multi-drug-resistant organisms. Reserve group antibiotics should be treated as “last resort” options.

    The use of the Not classified/Not recommended antibiotics is not evidence-based, nor recommended in high-quality international guidelines.  WHO does not recommend the use of these antibiotics in clinical practice.

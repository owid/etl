    <- if aware == "A" ->
    Access antibiotics have activity against a wide range of common pathogens and show lower resistance potential than antibiotics in the other groups.
    <- elif aware == "W" ->
    Watch antibiotic have higher resistance potential and include most of the highest priority agents among the Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine and/or antibiotics that are at relatively high risk of bacterial resistance.
    <- elif aware == "R" ->
    Reserve antibiotics  should be reserved for treatment of confirmed or suspected infections due to multi-drug-resistant organisms. Reserve group antibiotics should be treated as “last resort” options.
    <- elif aware == "O" ->
    The use of the Not classified/Not recommended antibiotics is not evidence-based, nor recommended in high-quality international guidelines.  WHO does not recommend the use of these antibiotics in clinical practice.

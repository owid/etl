          - "'Common' in this context refers to infections that occur most frequently in both hospitalized and community patients and constitute a majority of indications for antimicrobial treatment (such as urinary tract infections, enteric infections, bloodstream infections, respiratory infections etc). Also indicates that the spectrum is broader than e.g. epidemic-prone (notifiable) infections. Bacterial pathogens causing these infections could be called common pathogens, but just because they cause common infections and so isolated most frequently.‡ Community patients would be in many instances outpatients or those patients within 48 hours of admission in line with GLASS definition§ The term consumption refers to estimates that are derived from aggregated data sources, mainly sales data, and serves as proxy for actual use of antibiotics. Data on antibiotic use refers to estimates derived from individual level data, and may be accompanied by information on patient characteristics and indication of treatment."

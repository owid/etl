        title: Cantril ladder score for people aged << age_group >>
        unit: ""
        short_unit: ""
        description_short: Average of survey responses for people aged << age_group >>. The survey question asks respondents their current position on a hypothetical [ladder](#dod:cantril-ladder), where the best possible life for them is a 10, and the worst possible life is a 0.
        description_processing: Average of regions is calculated by taking a population-weighted average over all countries within that region.
        description_key:
          - The Cantril ladder asks respondents to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale.
          - The rankings are three-year averages, calculated by the World Happiness report based on nationally representative samples collected by the Gallup World Poll. This data is averaged over the responses from 2021 to 2023.
          - The number of people and countries surveyed varies year to year, but typically more than 100,000 people in 130 countries participate in the Gallup World Poll each year.
          - The rankings are based entirely on the survey scores, using the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative.

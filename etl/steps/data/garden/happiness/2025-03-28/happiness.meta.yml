        title: Cantril ladder score
        unit: ""
        short_unit: ""
        description_short: Average of survey responses. The survey question asks respondents their current possition on a hypothetical [ladder](#dod:cantril-ladder), where the best possible life for them is a 10, and the worst possible life is a 0.
        description_processing: Average of regions is calculated by taking a population-weighted average over all countries within that region.
        description_key:
          - The Cantril ladder asks respondents to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale.
          - The rankings are three-year averages, calculated by the World Happiness report based on nationally representative samples collected by the Gallup World Poll. The data for the 2025 report will draw from survey data from 2022-2024.
          - We show the data for final year of the three-year survey period, i.e. we show the 2022-2024 survey data for the year 2024.
          - The number of people and countries surveyed varies year to year, but typically more than 100,000 people in 130 countries participate in the Gallup World Poll each year.
          - The rankings are based entirely on the survey scores, using the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative.

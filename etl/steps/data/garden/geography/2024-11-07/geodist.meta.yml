        title: Neighbouring countries
        description_short: This indicator takes the value 1 if the two countries are neighbouring and 0 otherwise.

        title: Common official language
        description_short: This indicator takes the value 1 if the two countries have the same official language and 0 otherwise.

      comlang_ethno:
        title: Common language
        description_short: This indicator takes the value 1 if the two countries have the same language spoken by at least 9% of the population of both countries. It is 0 otherwise.

      colony:
        title: Colonial relationship
        description_short: This indicator takes the value 1 if the two countries ever had a colonial relationship (as colonizer/ colonized) and 0 otherwise.

        short_unit: ""
      comcol:
        title: Common colonizer after 1945
        description_short: This indicator takes the value 1 if the two countries had the same colonizer at some point after 1945 and 0 otherwise.
        unit: ""
        short_unit: ""
      curcol:
        title: Current colonial relationship
        description_short: This indicator takes the value 1 if the two countries currently have a colonial relationship (as colonizer/ colonized) and 0 otherwise.
        unit: ""

        title: Colonial relationship after 1945
        description_short: This indicator takes the value 1 if the two countries had a colonial relationship (as colonizer/ colonized) after 1945 and 0 otherwise.

      dist_populous_city:
        title: Distance between most populated cities
        description_short: Distance between the most populated cities of two countries in km.
        unit: Kilometers
        short_unit: km
      dist_capital_city:
        title: Distance between capitals
        description_short: Distance between the capitals of two countries in km.
        unit: Kilometers
        short_unit: km
      dist_weighted_arithmetic:
        title: Distance between the two countries
        description_short: Weighted distance measure between countries in km. This uses the arithmetic mean of city-to-city bilateral distances weighted by the share of the city in the overall country’s population.
        unit: Kilometers
        short_unit: km
        description_from_producer: |-
          The weighted distance measures use city-level data to assess the geographic distribution of population inside each nation. The idea is to calculate distance between two countries based on bilateral distances between the largest cities of those two countries, those inter-city distances being weighted by the share of the city in the overall country’s population. The distance formula used is a generalized mean of city-to-city bilateral distances developed by Head and Mayer (2002), which takes the arithmetic mean and the harmonic means as special cases.
      dist_weighted_harmonic:
        title: Distance between the two countries
        description_short: Weighted distance measure between countries in km. This uses the harmonic mean of city-to-city bilateral distances weighted by the share of the city in the overall country’s population.

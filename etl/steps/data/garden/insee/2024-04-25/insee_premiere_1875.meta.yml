        - Economic Inequality
      title_variant: Equivalised disposable household income
    processing_level: minor
  description_from_producer_inequality: |-
    The data from 1996 to 2011 are backcasted to allow a temporal comparison and may therefore differ from those published elsewhere on INSEE presenting the long series with breaks in the series in 2010 and 2012.
  description_from_producer_poverty: |-
    Includes people surveyed in Metropolitan France, living in a household whose declared income is positive or zero and whose reference person is not a student.
  description_key_post_tax_income: Income is ‘post-tax’ — measured after taxes have been paid and most government benefits have been received.
  description_key_equivalized_income: Income has been equivalized – adjusted to account for the fact that people in the same household can share costs like rent and heating.
  description_key_relative_poverty: This is a measure of _relative_ poverty – it captures the share of people whose income is low by the standards typical in their own country.

            Famines are assessed based on severity, magnitude, and duration. Magnitude, measured as the total number of excess deaths, was used to determine inclusion in the catalogue. A threshold of 100,000 deaths was applied due to limited demographic research on proportional death rate increases.

          Famine causes are classified into four main triggers: climatic adversity, government policies, armed conflict, and genocide. These simplified categories, drawn from academic research, often overlap with political and economic factors. For example, the El Niño famines of the late 19th century were worsened by imperial conquest, while the 1984–85 Sudan famine, triggered by drought, was intensified by an exploitative political system.

          Some cases are difficult to classify. The 1932–33 Holodomor famine in Ukraine is debated, with some attributing it to Stalin’s genocidal intent and others to poor policies. It is classified here as "genocide." Similarly, the Darfur crisis (2003–05) is widely recognized as genocide, while the Tigray famine (2020–22) is currently labeled "armed conflict" pending further research.

          The concept of "famine crimes," where hunger is intentionally used as a weapon, is also included in the dataset. These cases highlight the deliberate nature of some famines and their devastating consequences.

          As a living document, the catalogue evolves with new data and expert input, aiming to refine its classifications and analyses to reflect the latest research.

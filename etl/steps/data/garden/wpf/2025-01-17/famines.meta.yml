            Famines are assessed based on severity, magnitude, and duration. Magnitude, measured as the total number of excess deaths, was used to determine inclusion in the catalogue. A threshold of 100,000 deaths was applied due to limited demographic research on proportional death rate increases.

        - Famines were classified into four main triggers - adverse climate, government policies, armed conflict, or genocide - though in reality, multiple factors, especially human decisions, almost always play a significant role in their development and severity.
        - Historical examples demonstrate this complexity, such as when El Niño-related famines in the late 19th century were made worse by imperial conquest, and when the 1984-85 Sudan famine, initially triggered by drought, was intensified by exploitative politics.
        - The Ukrainian Holodomor (1931-1933) is a subject of some controversy, with interpretations divided between Stalin’s genocidal intent and Soviet claims of unintentional policy failures; however, most scholars now classify it as genocide.
        - The Darfur crisis (2003-2005) also faced initial controversy before achieving scholarly consensus as genocide.
        - More recently, the Tigray famine (2020-2022) has been categorized as "armed conflict," though ongoing research may shift its classification.
        - The classification system continues to evolve as new research emerges and experts provide additional insights.

    description_processing: The deaths were assumed to be evenly distributed over the duration of each famine, except for the famine in China between 1958 and 1962, where the source provides a year-by-year breakdown of mortality.
    description_short: Deaths from famines that are estimated to have killed 100,000 people or more. Although categorized into four main triggers here, famines almost always result from a complex interplay of factors, with human decisions frequently influencing their severity and outcomes.
    description_key:
      - Famines were classified into four main triggers - adverse climate, government policies, armed conflict, or genocide - though in reality, multiple factors, especially human decisions, almost always play a significant role in their development and severity.
      - Historical examples demonstrate this complexity, such as when El Niño-related famines in the late 19th century were made worse by imperial conquest, and when the 1984-85 Sudan famine, initially triggered by drought, was intensified by exploitative politics.
      - The 1932-33 Ukrainian Holodomor is a subject of some controversy, with interpretations divided between Stalin’s genocidal intent and Soviet claims of unintentional policy failures; however, most scholars now classify it as genocide.
      - The Darfur crisis (2003-2005) also faced initial controversy before achieving scholarly consensus as genocide.
      - More recently, the Tigray famine (2020-2022) has been categorized as "armed conflict," though ongoing research may shift its classification.
      - The classification system continues to evolve as new research emerges and experts provide additional insights.

     Decadal figures represent data averaged over each ten-year period (e.g., 1990–1999 for the 1990s). The 2020s figure is provisional and includes data only up to and including 2023.

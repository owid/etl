    description_short: Deaths in famines that are estimated to have killed 100,000 people or more.
    description_key:
      - WPF defines a famine as mass mortality due to mass starvation, with mass starvation being the "destruction, deprivation or loss of objects and activities required for survival".
    description_processing: The deaths were assumed to be evenly distributed over the duration of each famine, except for the famine in China between 1958 and 1962, where the source provides a year-by-year breakdown of mortality.
    description_from_producer: |-
      Famines are assessed based on severity, magnitude, and duration. Magnitude, measured as the total number of excess deaths, was used to determine inclusion in the catalogue. A threshold of 100,000 deaths was applied due to limited demographic research on proportional death rate increases.

            note: Decadal figures represent data averaged over each ten-year period (e.g., 1990â€“1999 for the 1990s). The 2020s figure is provisional and includes data only up to and including 2023.

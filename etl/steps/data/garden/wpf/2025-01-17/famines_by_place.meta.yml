    description_short: Deaths in famines that are estimated to have killed 100,000 people or more.
    description_key:
      - WPF defines a famine as mass mortality due to mass starvation, with mass starvation being the "destruction, deprivation or loss of objects and activities required for survival".
      - WPF coded the most credible estimate of the number of deaths across sources. If there were several equally credible estimates, WPF used their median.
      - The 1910–1919 famine in British Somaliland and the African Red Sea Region (Sudan, Northern Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Djibouti) is treated as a single event because the 100,000+ mortality estimate applies to the entire region, not individual areas.
      - For the Ottoman Empire (1894–1896), East Africa (1896–1900), and the combined Somaliland–African Red Sea Region famine (1910–1919), the 100,000 death estimate is a **minimum**, meaning the actual death toll was likely higher.

     Decadal figures represent data averaged over each ten-year period (e.g., 1990–1999 for the 1990s). The 2020s figure is provisional and includes data only up to and including 2023.

       gdp_per_capita:
          description_processing: When GDP data was missing for certain years but nearby estimates were available, we used the closest or most relevant data. For example, during Cuba's famine from 1895 to 1898, we used the GDP from 1892. For China’s famine from 1876 to 1879, we used the average GDP from 1870 to 1887. In special cases like Russia and Kazakhstan (1932 to 1934), we used the USSR’s average GDP from 1940 to 1946. For recent gaps, we used 2022 data for countries like the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, and Syria.

       regime_redux_row_owid:
        description_processing: Closed and electoral autocracies here were treated as “autocracies”. The regime classification is 0 for autocracies and 1 for democracies.

       population_growth:
         title: Population growth rate 20 years prior to famine
         unit: '%'
         short_unit: '%'
         description_short: The average annual population growth rate in the 20 years before the famine.
         description_processing: The population growth rate was calculated by taking the population in the year of the famine and dividing it by the population 20 years prior, subtracting 1, and multiplying by 100.

       midpoint_year:
          title: Midpoint year of famine
          unit: ''
          description_processing: The midpoint year of the famine is the year halfway between the start and end of the famine.

       country:
          title: Country
          unit: ''
          description_short: Country where the famine occurred.

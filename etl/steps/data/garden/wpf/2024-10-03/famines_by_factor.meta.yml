       title: Deaths from famines where conflict was a factor
       description_short: Famines that are estimated to have killed 100,000 people or more. Includes factors like "war," "blockade," "counterinsurgency," "occupation," "siege," "forced starvation," and "genocide," all of which disrupt food supply and access and can either cause or contribute to famine.
       unit: 'deaths'

     sum_government_policy_overall_mortality_factor:
        title: Deaths from famines where government policy was a factor
        description_short: Famines that are estimated to have killed 100,000 people or more. Includes actions such as "economic policy," "colonial policy," "taxation," "state capacity," and "forced labor," reflecting how government decisions and structures can limit food availability and access, serving as either causal or contributing factors in famine.
        unit: 'deaths'

     sum_external_factors_mortality_factor:
        title: Deaths from famines where external factors was a factor
        description_short: Famines that are estimated to have killed 100,000 people or more.Includes factors like "climate," "environment," and "disease," representing natural and environmental conditions outside direct human control that affect food production.
        unit: 'deaths'

Includes factors like "war," "blockade," "counterinsurgency," "occupation," "siege," "forced starvation," and "genocide," all of which disrupt food supply and access and can either cause or contribute to famine.

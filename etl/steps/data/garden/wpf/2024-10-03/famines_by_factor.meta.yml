       description_short: Famines estimated to have caused over 100,000 deaths, where factors like "war," "blockade," "counterinsurgency," "occupation," "siege," "forced starvation," and "genocide" contributed to disrupting food supply and access.

        title: Deaths from famines where government policy was a factor
        description_short: Famines estimated to have killed 100,000 or more, where government actions like "economic policy," "colonial policy," "taxation," "state capacity," and "forced labor" contributed to limiting food availability and access.

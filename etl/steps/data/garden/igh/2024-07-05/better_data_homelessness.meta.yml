        description_short: The category of the IGH Framework that the homelessness data falls under.
        description_key:
          - The IGH Global Framework captures three broad categories of people who may be considered homeless, defined as "lacking access to minimally adequate housing". These categories are (1) People without accommodation, (2) People living in temporary or crisis accommodation, and (3) People living in severely inadequate or insecure accommodation.
          - Among the first category, people without accommodation, the IGH Framework distinguishes (1A) People sleeping in the streets or in other open spaces, (1B) People sleeping in public roofed spaces or buidlings not intended for human habitation, (1C) People sleeping in their cars, rickshaws, open fishing boats and other forms of transport, and (1D) "Pavement dwellers" - individuals or households who live on the street in a regular spot, usually with some form of makeshift cover.
          - Among the second category, people living in temporary or crisis accommodation, the IGH Framework distinguishes (2A) People staying in night shelters, (2B) People living in homeless hostels and other types of temporary accommodation, (2C) Women and children living in refuges for those fleeing domestic violence, (2D) People living in camps provided for "internally displaced people", and (2E) People living in camps or reception centres/temporary accommodation for asylum seekers, refugees and other immigrants.
          - Among the third category, people living in severely inadequate or insecure accommodation, the IGH Framework distinguishes (3A) People sharing with friends and relatives on a temporary basis, (3B) People living under threat of violence, (3C) People living in cheap hotels, bed and breakfasts and similar, (3D) People squatting in conventional housing, (3E) People living in conventional housing that is unfit for human habitation, (3F) People living in trailers, caravans and tents, (3G) People living in extremely overcrowded conditions, and (3H) People living in non-conventional buildings and temporary structures, including those living in slums/informal settlements.
          - Within the framework, IGH targets programs and research primarily toward those in Category 1 and in a subset of Category 2 (2A-2C).

          We have simplified the original version of the IGH Framework Category in order to make the metric more clear in a chart. Regardless of the subcategories, we classify the homelessness data into these categories:

          - "People without accommodation" refers to mentions to the category 1 of the IGH Framework.
          - "People living in temporary or crisis accommodation" refers to mentions to the category 2 of the IGH Framework.
          - "People living in severely inadequate and insecure accommodation" refers to mentions to the category 3 of the IGH Framework.
          - "No or in temporary accommodation" refers to mentions to the categories 1 and 2 of the IGH Framework.
          - "No or in inadequate accommodation" refers to mentions to the categories 1 and 3 of the IGH Framework.
          - "In temporary or inadequate accommodation" refers to mentions to the categories 2 and 3 of the IGH Framework.
          - "No or in temporary or inadequate accommodation" refers to mentions to the categories 1, 2 and 3 of the IGH Framework.
          - "Not enough information" refers to the cases where the definition does not align or provide enough detail for IGH Framework classification.

Methodology comprises whether the methodology used to collect the homelessness data is listed by the source and whether the enumeration is from a primary data source. Timeliness includes whether the enumeration was conducted within the last four years and whether the enumeration was conducted at the same time of year or based on routinely updated data. Definition measures whether the definition of homelessness includes people without accommodation, living in emergency accommodation, and living in insecure or inadequate housing. Geographic Scope assesses whether the geographic scope of the data is listed by the source and dissagregation by region, city, or community. Disaggregation assesses whether the data is disaggregated by gender, age or two additional categories (disability status, income, race or ethnicity, migratory status, length of time homeless, and relevant health data)."

        description_from_producer: |-
          After gathering information related to countries’ homelessness enumeration and data practices, we evaluated countries according to our Homeless Data Scorecard (HDS). The HDS is an 11-point scale that provides a rough assessment of the current state of a country’s enumeration and data practices. Countries were given one point for each criterion satisfied under the five key categories discussed in the “Homeless Data Scorecard” section above - Methodology, Timeliness, Definition, Geographic Scope, and Disaggregation. The scale is unweighted. In other words, in awarding one point for disaggregation by gender and one point for enumerations occuring within the last four years, we are not implying that the satisfaction of one criterion is as important as the other. Furthermore, two countries being awarded a point for satisfying the same criteria should not be taken to imply that both countries have satisfied the criteria in the same way. For instance, whereas two countries may satisfy the criterion of “methodology listed,” one country may simply state that data was produced through a street count, while the other country may issue comprehensive reports detailing their data collection tactics and statistical methods used to arrive at their estimate. In cases where the relative lack of contextual information regarding how a country’s data was produced was insufficient to make a determination, countries were not scored according to the HDS.

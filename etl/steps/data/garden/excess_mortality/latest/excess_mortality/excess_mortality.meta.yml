  title: Excess Mortality (various sources)
  description: |-
    All-cause mortality data is from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) Short-term Mortality Fluctuations project and the World Mortality Dataset (WMD). Both sources are updated weekly.

    We do not use the data from some countries in WMD because they fail to meet the following data quality criteria: 1) at least three years of historical data; and 2) data published either weekly or monthly. The full list of excluded countries and reasons for exclusion can be found in this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JPMtzsx-smO3_K4ReK_HMeuVLEzVZ71qHghSuAfG788/edit?usp=sharing.

    For a full list of source information (i.e., HMD or WMD) country by country, see: https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid#source-information-country-by-country.

    We calculate P-scores using the reported deaths data from HMD and WMD and the projected deaths since 2020 from WMD (which we use for all countries and regions, including for deaths broken down by age group). The P-score is the percentage difference between the reported number of weekly or monthly deaths since 2020 and the projected number of deaths for the same period based on previous years (years available from 2015 until 2019).

    We calculate the number of weekly deaths for the United Kingdom by summing the weekly deaths from England & Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

    For important issues and caveats to understand when interpreting excess mortality data, see our excess mortality page at https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid.

    For a more detailed description_short of the HMD data, including week date definitions, the coverage (of individuals, locations, and time), whether dates are for death occurrence or registration, the original national source information, and important caveats, see the HMD metadata file at https://www.mortality.org/Public/STMF_DOC/STMFmetadata.pdf.

    For a more detailed description_short of the WMD data, including original source information, see their GitHub page at https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality.

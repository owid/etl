      - Data from The Economist estimating the number of excess deaths, from all causes, during the COVID-19 pandemic for 223 countries & regions. The Economist publishes new estimates each day. We update our charts with the latest available data each week.
      - Excess deaths measure the difference between how many people died during the pandemic, from any cause, and how many deaths would have been expected had there been no pandemic.
      - Many countries have not reported any all-cause mortality data during the pandemic, which means their entire data series is estimated. Other countries report data regularly, but it is not always up-to-date due to delays in reporting; for these, only recent weeks are estimated. These delays, as well as incomplete reporting coverage, mean the reported number of deaths might not count all deaths that occurred.

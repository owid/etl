  years: |
    Years are defined from last date aggregations available in the Colonial Dates Dataset. This means that when sources differ, years of colonization are defined from the last date between them. This is different from mean date aggregations (also available), which averages the dates of colonization across the original sources.

    Years have been expanded to show the full range of years in the dataset, from 1462 to 2022. The original dataset only includes the years where a country was colonized.

          The indicator has been processed to identify the European colonial powers as "Colonizers", the countries not colonized as "Not colonized" and the countries colonized for multiple colonizers in the same year as the name of the colonizers separated by "-".

          The indicator is constructed by filling years with no colonizers with the last colonizer in the time series for each country.

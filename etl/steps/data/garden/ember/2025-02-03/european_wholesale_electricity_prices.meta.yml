      - Wholesale electricity prices are the average spot prices in the day-ahead market, where electricity is traded for delivery to consumers the following day. These prices fluctuate based on supply and demand and are typically set on an hourly basis.
      - Prices are measured in euros per [megawatt-hour](#dod:watt-hours).
      - These are the prices paid to electricity producers and do not represent the final cost for households or businesses, which also includes additional costs like distribution, transmission, and taxes.
      - To account for inflation, prices have been adjusted using the Producer Price Index (PPI) for energy, with 2015 as the reference year.
    description_processing: |-
      To account for inflation, prices have been divided by the Producer Price Index (PPI) for energy (and multiplied by 100), using 2015 as the reference year. This adjusts for changes in producer costs over time, providing a more consistent measure of price trends.

      - Wholesale electricity prices are the average spot prices in the day-ahead market, where electricity is traded for delivery to consumers the following day. These prices fluctuate based on supply and demand and are typically set on an hourly basis.
      - Prices are measured in euros per [megawatt-hour](#dod:watt-hours).
      - These are the prices paid to electricity producers and do not represent the final cost for households or businesses, which also includes additional costs like distribution, transmission, and taxes.

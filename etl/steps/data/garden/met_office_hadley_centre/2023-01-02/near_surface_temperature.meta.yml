  title: Near-surface temperature anomaly (Met Office Hadley Centre, 2022)
  description: |
    Temperature anomalies are based on the HadCRUT5 near-surface temperature dataset as published by the Met Office Hadley Centre. Temperature anomalies are given in degrees celsius relative to the average temperature over the period 1961-1990.

    These are available for the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. The global mean has been calculated by averaging anomalies for northern and southern hemispheres.

      exports_of_goods__free_on_board__fob__share:

        unit: "%"

        description_short: "Exports of goods: << counterpart_country >> as a percentage of the region's total exports of goods."
        description_key:
          - This indicator shows what percentage of a region's total goods exports go to a specific trading partner.
          - Calculated by dividing exports to the counterpart region by total exports to all countries, then multiplying by 100.
          - Based on Free on Board (FOB) valuation, which includes the value of goods plus all costs of bringing them to the border of the exporting country.
          - Values sum to 100% across all trading partners for each country-year, providing a complete picture of export concentration.
          - A higher percentage indicates greater trade dependence on that particular trading partner for exports.
          - Changes over time can reflect shifts in trade relationships, economic policies, or competitive dynamics.
          - Data is derived from customs records and official trade statistics compiled by national statistical offices.

        description_key:
          - This indicator shows what percentage of a region's total goods imports come from a specific trading partner.
          - Calculated by dividing imports from the counterpart region by total imports from all countries, then multiplying by 100.
          - Based on Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) valuation, which includes the total cost of bringing goods to the importing region's border.
          - Values sum to 100% across all trading partners for each country-year, showing the complete import composition.
          - A higher percentage indicates greater import dependence on that particular trading partner.
          - Changes can reflect diversification strategies, supply chain shifts, or changes in trade agreements.
          - Data is compiled from customs declarations and import documentation by national statistical offices.

        short_unit: "%"
        description_short: "Net trade in goods: << counterpart_country >> as a percentage of the region's total trade volume (exports plus imports)."
        description_key:
          - This indicator shows the trade balance with a specific partner relative to the region's overall trade activity.
          - Calculated as the trade balance (exports minus imports) divided by total trade volume (exports plus imports), then multiplied by 100.
          - A positive value indicates a trade surplus with that partner relative to total trade size, while negative indicates a deficit.
          - Unlike absolute trade balances, this measure accounts for the overall scale of trade activity.
          - Values closer to zero indicate more balanced trade relationships relative to total trade volume.
          - This measure helps identify which trading relationships contribute most significantly to overall trade imbalances.
          - Provides insight into trade concentration and dependency beyond simple bilateral balance measures.

        description_key:
          - This indicator shows what percentage of a region's total trade volume is conducted with a specific trading partner.
          - Calculated by dividing bilateral trade volume (exports plus imports with the counterpart country) by total trade volume (exports plus imports with all countries), then multiplying by 100.
          - Values sum to 100% across all trading partners for each country-year, providing a complete picture of trade concentration.
          - A higher percentage indicates greater overall trade dependence on that particular trading partner.
          - This measure captures the total economic relationship intensity, considering both export and import flows.
          - Changes over time can reflect shifts in trade relationships, economic integration, or diversification strategies.
          - Useful for identifying major trading partners and assessing trade concentration risks.

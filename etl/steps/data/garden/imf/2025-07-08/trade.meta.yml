      exports_of_goods__free_on_board__fob__share:
        title: Share of total exports of goods (FOB) to << counterpart_country >>
        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
        description_short: Exports of goods to << counterpart_country >> as a percentage of the country's total exports of goods.
        description_key:
          - This indicator shows what percentage of a country's total goods exports go to a specific trading partner.
          - Calculated by dividing exports to the counterpart country by total exports to all countries, then multiplying by 100.
          - Based on Free on Board (FOB) valuation, which includes the value of goods plus all costs of bringing them to the border of the exporting country.
          - Values sum to 100% across all trading partners for each country-year, providing a complete picture of export concentration.
          - A higher percentage indicates greater trade dependence on that particular trading partner for exports.
          - Changes over time can reflect shifts in trade relationships, economic policies, or competitive dynamics.
          - Data is derived from customs records and official trade statistics compiled by national statistical offices.

        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
        description_short: Imports of goods from << counterpart_country >> as a percentage of the country's total imports of goods.
        description_key:
          - This indicator shows what percentage of a country's total goods imports come from a specific trading partner.
          - Calculated by dividing imports from the counterpart country by total imports from all countries, then multiplying by 100.
          - Based on Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) valuation, which includes the total cost of bringing goods to the importing country's border.
          - Values sum to 100% across all trading partners for each country-year, showing the complete import composition.
          - A higher percentage indicates greater import dependence on that particular trading partner.
          - Changes can reflect diversification strategies, supply chain shifts, or changes in trade agreements.
          - Data is compiled from customs declarations and import documentation by national statistical offices.

        title: Trade balance of goods with << counterpart_country >> as share of total trade volume
        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
        description_short: Net trade in goods with << counterpart_country >> as a percentage of the country's total trade volume (exports plus imports).
        description_key:
          - This indicator shows the trade balance with a specific partner relative to the country's overall trade activity.
          - Calculated as the trade balance (exports minus imports) divided by total trade volume (exports plus imports), then multiplied by 100.
          - A positive value indicates a trade surplus with that partner relative to total trade size, while negative indicates a deficit.
          - Unlike absolute trade balances, this measure accounts for the overall scale of trade activity.
          - Values closer to zero indicate more balanced trade relationships relative to total trade volume.
          - This measure helps identify which trading relationships contribute most significantly to overall trade imbalances.
          - Provides insight into trade concentration and dependency beyond simple bilateral balance measures.

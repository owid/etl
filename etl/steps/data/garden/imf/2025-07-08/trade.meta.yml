        title: Imports of goods from << counterpart_country >> (CIF, current US$)
        unit: "current US$"
        short_unit: "US$"
        description_short: Total value of goods a country imports from << counterpart_country >>, including freight and insurance costs.
        description_key:
          - This indicator shows the total value of merchandise imports that a country brings in from a partner country.
          - Imports are valued on a CIF basis (Cost, Insurance, and Freight). This means the values include the cost of the goods, as well as the transport and insurance costs to deliver them to the importing country’s border.
          - The measure covers **goods only**, not services such as software, tourism, or financial services.
          - Values are expressed in **current US dollars**. They are not adjusted for inflation, so part of the increase over time may reflect rising prices rather than larger trade volumes.
          - This indicator is useful for understanding the scale of trade relations and economic dependence on specific partner countries.
          - The numbers reflect official trade statistics and may vary depending on reporting methods used by each country.

        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
        description_short: The value of goods imported from China, including freight and insurance costs, as a percentage of a country’s [gross domestic product (GDP)](#dod:gdp).
        description_key:
          - This indicator shows how much of a country’s economic output is equivalent to the value of goods it imports from China.
          - Import values are measured on a CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) basis. This means they include the price of the goods, plus transport and insurance costs to bring them to the importer’s border.
          - GDP figures were taken from the World Bank and calculated as GDP per capita multiplied by population, both expressed in current US dollars.
          - Expressing imports as a share of GDP highlights the scale of economic dependence on Chinese goods relative to the overall size of the economy.
          - A higher percentage indicates that Chinese imports play a larger role in the economy, while a lower percentage suggests less reliance on China as a supplier.
        description_processing: Shares were calculated by dividing the value of CIF imports from China by GDP, and multiplying the result by 100. Import data were sourced directly from official trade statistics and valued in current US dollars. GDP was computed from World Bank indicators as (GDP per capita × population), both measured in current US dollars. This approach ensured consistency across countries and years. Calculations were performed for each country–year, but values were only displayed on rows where the counterpart was World, to prevent duplication.

  # Reusable description components
  goods_only: &goods_only The measure covers **goods only**, not services such as software, tourism, or financial services.
  current_usd: &current_usd Values are expressed in **current US dollars**. They are not adjusted for inflation, so part of the increase over time may reflect rising prices rather than larger trade volumes.

  fob_basis: &fob_basis Exports are valued on an FOB basis (Free on Board). This means the values include the cost of the goods up to the exporter's border, but exclude transport and insurance costs after that point.
  cif_basis: &cif_basis Imports are valued on a CIF basis (Cost, Insurance, and Freight). This means the values include the cost of the goods, as well as the transport and insurance costs to deliver them to the importing country's border.

      exports_of_goods__free_on_board__fob__us_dollar:
        title: Exports of goods (Free on Board, FOB) in US dollars to the << counterpart_country >>
        unit: US $
        short_unit: $
        description_short: Total value of goods exported to << counterpart_country >>, measured at Free on Board (FOB) prices in US dollars.
        description_key:
          - Free on Board (FOB) valuation includes the value of goods plus all costs of bringing the goods to the border of the exporting country, including loading onto the transport vessel.
          - FOB prices exclude international freight, insurance, and other costs beyond the exporting country's border.
          - This is the standard valuation method for exports as it reflects the value received by the exporting country.
          - Data is compiled from customs records and other official trade statistics by national statistical offices.
          - Figures are converted to US dollars using market exchange rates, which may introduce volatility due to currency fluctuations.
          - Re-exports (goods imported and then exported without substantial transformation) may be included depending on national accounting practices.
          - Some countries may use different commodity classification systems, which can affect comparability over time or across countries.

      imports_of_goods__cost_insurance_freight__cif__us_dollar:
        title: Imports of goods (Cost, Insurance, Freight, CIF) in US dollars from the << counterpart_country >>
        unit: US $
        short_unit: $
        description_short: Total value of goods imported from << counterpart_country >>, measured at Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) prices in US dollars.
        description_key:
          - Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) valuation includes the value of goods plus all costs of bringing them to the border of the importing country.
          - CIF prices include international freight charges, insurance premiums, and other delivery costs to the destination country.
          - This is the standard valuation method for imports as it reflects the total cost to the importing country.
          - Data is compiled from customs declarations and import documentation by national statistical offices.
          - Figures are converted to US dollars using market exchange rates, which may introduce volatility due to currency fluctuations.
          - The difference between CIF and FOB values represents the cost of international transport and insurance services.
          - Customs procedures and valuation methods may vary between countries, affecting data comparability.

      trade_balance_goods__us_dollar:
        title: Trade balance of goods in US dollars with the << counterpart_country >>
        unit: US $
        short_unit: $
        description_short: Net trade in goods with << counterpart_country >>, calculated as exports minus imports, in US dollars.
        description_key:
          - Trade balance is calculated as the value of exports (FOB) minus the value of imports (CIF) for goods only.
          - A positive balance indicates a trade surplus (exports exceed imports), while a negative balance indicates a trade deficit (imports exceed exports).
          - The use of different valuation methods (FOB for exports, CIF for imports) means the global trade balance will not sum to zero due to freight and insurance costs.
          - This measure excludes trade in services, which can be substantial for some countries and trading relationships.
          - Changes in the trade balance can reflect shifts in economic competitiveness, exchange rates, trade policies, or economic conditions.
          - Data is derived from national customs statistics and may be subject to revision as more complete information becomes available.
          - Bilateral trade balances may not match when reported by both trading partners due to differences in recording methods, timing, and classification systems.

        title: Computational capacity of the fastest supercomputer
        description_short: The maximum computational capacity (Rmax) of the world's fastest supercomputer.
        unit: gigaflops per second
        short_unit: GFLOPS/s
        processing_level: major
        description_key:
          - Computational capacity is measured using the LINPACK benchmark, which solves a dense system of linear equations.
          - Rmax represents the maximal LINPACK performance achieved by the system, indicating the highest sustained performance.
          - One gigaflop per second (GFLOPS/s) equals one billion floating-point operations per second.
          - For each year, we report the peak performance of the fastest supercomputer from the TOP500 list.
        description_from_producer: The Rmax value is the maximal LINPACK performance achieved by the system.
        description_processing: Data is aggregated from all TOP500 lists published between 1993 and 2025. For each year, we select the maximum Rmax value across all lists published in that year. Performance values are converted from teraflops per second (TFlop/s) to gigaflops per second (GFlop/s) by multiplying by 1000.

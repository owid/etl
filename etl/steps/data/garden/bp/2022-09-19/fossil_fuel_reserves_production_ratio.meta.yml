  title: Fossil fuel reserves/production ratio
  short_name: fossil_fuel_reserves_production_ratio
  description: |
    The Reserves-to-Production (R/P) Ratio measures the number of years of fuel supplies left based on current annual consumption rates. Note that this can change through time through the discovery of new fuel reserves, and increases in annual consumption.

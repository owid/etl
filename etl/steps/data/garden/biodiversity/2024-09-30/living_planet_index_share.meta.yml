    variables:
      share_increasing:
        title: Share of populations increasing
        description_short: The share of native, vertebrate populations that have increased by more than 5% over the study period.
      share_decreasing:
        title: Share of populations decreasing
        description_short: The share of native, vertebrate populations that have decreased by more than 5% over the study period.
      share_stable:
        title: Share of populations stable
        description_short: The share of native, vertebrate populations that are stable in size, meaning that they have changed by less than 5% over the study period.

    description_key:
      - For global values a species may be counted multiple times, if the species was found in different regions (one first record per species and region). A region mostly refers to countries and some distinguished islands such as Hawaii, Azores or Sicily.
      - For continental values, only the very first record of a species on a continent is considered. That is, a species has at maximum one first record per continent.

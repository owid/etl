            subtitle: >
              The vertical axis shows the date of peak blossom, expressed as the number
              of days since 1st January. The timing of the peak cherry blossom is influenced by
              spring temperatures. Higher temperatures due to climate change have caused the peak
              blossom to gradually move earlier in the year since the early 20th century.

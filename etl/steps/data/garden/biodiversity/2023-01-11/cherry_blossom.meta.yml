              The World Development Indicators (WDI) is the primary
              World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled
              from officially-recognized international sources. It
              presents the most current and accurate global development
              data available, and includes national, regional and
              global estimates.

          title_public: Share of the population using the Internet
          title_variant: WDI
          description_short: Share of the population who used the Internet in the last three months.
          description_from_producer: >
            Internet users are individuals who have used the Internet (from any location)
            in the last 3 months. The Internet can be used via a computer, mobile phone,
            personal digital assistant, games machine, digital TV etc.

            Limitations and exceptions: Operators have traditionally been the main source
            of telecommunications data, so information on subscriptions has been widely
            available for most countries. This gives a general idea of access, but a more
            precise measure is the penetration rate - the share of households with access
            to telecommunications. During the past few years more information on
            information and communication technology use has become available from
            household and business surveys. Also important are data on actual use of
            telecommunications services. Ideally, statistics on telecommunications (and
            other information and communications technologies) should be compiled for all
            three measures: subscriptions, access, and use. The quality of data varies
            among reporting countries as a result of differences in regulations covering
            data provision and availability.

            Discrepancies may also arise in cases where the end of a fiscal year differs
            from that used by ITU, which is the end of December of every year. A number of
            countries have fiscal years that end in March or June of every
            year.

            Statistical concept and methodology: The Internet is a world-wide public
            computer network. It provides access to a number of communication services
            including the World Wide Web and carries email, news, entertainment and data
            files, irrespective of the device used (not assumed to be only via a computer -
            it may also be by mobile phone, PDA, games machine, digital TV etc.). Access
            can be via a fixed or mobile network. For additional/latest information on

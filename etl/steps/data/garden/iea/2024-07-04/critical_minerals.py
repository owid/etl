"""Curate data from the IEA's Critical Minerals Dataset.

Analysis of the Critical Mineral Dataset file:
* Sheet 2 is the only table on supply, which is also the only table with country data.
  NOTE: Region aggregates are not possible, since there is data for "Rest of world" for each mineral.
* Sheets 4.1, ..., 4.6 are called, e.g. "4.1 Solar" (so let's call them 4.x sheets, or individual demand sheets). They contain all relevant data on demand for individual technologies.
* Sheet 3.1 (called "3.1 Cleantech demand by tech") contains a summary of the main minerals used in clean tech listed in the 4.x sheets.
  NOTE: This sheet seems to assume "Base case", even if it doesn't explicitly mention it.
  But sheet 3.1 also contains an additional entity (called "Other low emissions power generation") that corresponds to uses of those minerals for which there is not an individual sheet. They need to be taken into account.
  For example, Chromium only appears in the "4.2 Wind" sheet, with 63.27kt in 2023 (base case). This use is accounted for in sheet 3.1. But in sheet 3.1 we also see "Other low emissions power generation", 148.76kt. So this needs to be taken into account.
* Sheet 3.2 (called "3.2 Cleantech demand by mineral") includes the total uses of minerals in clean tech. It includes minerals that are not in 3.1. So, we can compute the totals from 4.x, and, whatever is left in the 3.2 totals can be assigned to "Other low emissions power generation". Then we can safely ignore sheet 3.1.
  NOTE: This sheet seems to assume "Base case", even if it doesn't explicitly mention it.
  NOTE: There is one mineral that appears in 3.1 and not in 3.2, namely "PGMs". One could think that this is the sum of "Iridium" plus "PGMs (other than iridum)" (also, note that this is misspelled!). However, by looking at the numbers, "PGMs" in 3.1 seems to coincide exactly with "PGMs (other than iridum)".
* Finally, Sheet 1 contains a summary of all demand data from other sheets. However, it also includes uses of minerals from non-clean technologies. This is called "Other uses", and needs to be accounted for. For example, in the case of copper, uses in clean tech amount to 6372kt, and other uses add up to 19543kt.
    NOTE: Sheet 1 contains 2 (aggregate) minerals that are not in sheet 3.2, namely
    - "Magnet rare earth elements". As they mention in the notes of sheet 1, this corresponds to praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), terbium (Tb) and dysprosium (Dy). Therefore, it should coincide with "Total rare earth elements" from sheet 3.2 (and it roughly does). The easiest solution (to avoid double counting and to be able to include other uses) is to remove the rows for the individual rare earth elements, and keep only "Total rare earth elements" (and rename them as "Magnet rare earth elements").
    - "Graphite (all grades: natural and synthetic)". This is the most problematic case. It shows, for example, 1147kt for EV, whereas, in the EV sheet, we see "Battery-grade graphite" 685.56kt (and no other use of graphite appears). A similar inconsistency happens with grid battery storage. So, it seems that there are additional uses of graphite that are not accounted for in the EV and battery storage sheets. We can include a "Graphite, other than battery-grade" mineral, with the difference.

Therefore, the strategy should be:
* Combine the 4.x sheets into one demand table.
* Assign a "case" column to sheet 3.2 (always assume Base case).
* In demand table, create an aggregate "Magnet rare earth elements" that combines Praseodymium, Neodymium, Terbium and Dysprosium.
* From sheet 3.2, remove rows for Praseodymium, Neodymium, Terbium and Dysprosium, and rename "Total rare earth elements" -> "Magnet rare earth elements". Also, fix the misspelled "iridum".
* Calculate "Other low emissions power generation", which should be the total from 3.2 minus the total from 4.x for each mineral. Add those other low emission uses to the demand table.
* Assign a "case" column to sheet 1.
* Add the other uses of graphite from sheet 1 to the demand table (EV and battery storage).
* Add "Other uses" from sheet 1 to the demand table.
* Sanity check that the totals from the resulting demand table coincides with the totals from sheet 1.

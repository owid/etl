      - The resulting costs are compiled from two IRENA reports: Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2024 (primarily for data from 2010 onwards) and Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2023 (for earlier data not included in the latest report).
      - Data from the Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2023 report (expressed in constant 2023 US dollars) was multiplied by a factor of 1.03, to convert to constant 2024 US dollars assuming a 3% inflation rate, based on [the US Inflation Calculator](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/).

      - Levelized cost of energy (LCOE) estimates the average cost per unit of energy generated across the lifetime of a new power plant. It is measured in US$ per kilowatt-hour.

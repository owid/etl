  - Non-food expenses are estimated by looking at how much low-income people typically spend on things like housing, clothing, and transportation.
  - This amount is calculated as the average share of non-food expenditure for a low-income consumer, multiplied by the international poverty line.
  - 'The average share of non-food expenditure is based on the spending habits of specific income groups (quintiles):

    - In upper-middle-income and high-income countries, the first quintile of consumers is considered (the poorest 20% of consumers), where people spend around 54% of their income on non-food needs.

    - In low-income and lower-middle-income countries, the second quintile is considered (the second lowest 20% of consumers), where people spend about 37% and 44% of their income on non-food needs, respectively.'
  - 'The international poverty lines (in [international-$](#dod:int_dollar_abbreviation) at 2017 prices) are:

    - For low-income countries: $2.15/day.

    - For lower-middle-income countries: $3.65/day.

    - For upper-middle-income countries: $6.85/day.

    - For high-income countries: $24.36/day.'
  - A value of zero indicates a null or a small number rounded down at the current precision level.

  - Population counts all residents regardless of legal status or citizenship.
  - A value of zero indicates a null or a small number rounded down at the current precision level.
  description_key_poverty_lines: &id003
  - 'Poverty lines are defined (in [international-$](#dod:int_dollar_abbreviation) at 2017 prices) as follows:

    - For low-income countries, $1.35/day (63% of the international poverty line of $2.15/day).

    - For lower-middle-income countries, $2.04/day (56% of the international poverty line of $3.65/day).

    - For upper-middle-income countries, $3.15/day (46% of the international poverty line of $6.85/day).

    - For high-income countries, $11.2/day (46% of the international poverty line of $24.36/day).'
  - These percentages (63%, 56%, and 46%) represent the average food expenditure shares in the first quintile (the poorest 20th of the population) of consumers in upper-middle-income and high-income countries,
    and the second quintile of consumers in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, according to household surveys compiled by the World Bank.
  description_healthy_diet: A healthy diet meets nutritional standards set by dietary guidelines, with sufficient diversity and quantity within and between food groups to achieve nutrient adequacy and protect
    against diet-related diseases.
  description_nutrient_adequate_diet: A nutrient adequate diet meets all essential nutrient requirements, with sufficient diversity and quantity of locally available foods to stay within the upper and lower
    bounds for total protein, fats, and carbohydrates as well as essential vitamins and minerals required to avoid nutrient deficiencies or toxicity.
  description_energy_sufficient_diet: An energy sufficient diet provides enough of a starchy staple food for day-to-day subsistence, without either nutrient adequacy or adherence to dietary guidelines.

  description_from_producer_healthy_diet: "The Cost of a Healthy Diet indicator provides a globally standardized metric to monitor food environments,  measuring a population\u2019s access to sufficient\
    \ food for an active and healthy life. For this metric, access to healthy diets is measured using the least expensive locally available items in sufficient quantities to meet national governments\u2019\
    \ food-based dietary guidelines.  For global monitoring, commonalities among those guidelines are represented by a Healthy Diet Basket, specifying a target number and quantity of eleven items balanced\
    \ across six nutritionally defined food groups. The items selected in each country to meet the global Healthy Diet Basket standard generally also achieve nutrient adequacy, at a similar cost to meeting\
    \ an individual country\u2019s own national dietary guidelines.\n\n_Limitations and exceptions_\n\nItem prices for the global Cost of a Healthy Diet indicator are reported by each national statistical\
    \ organization through the International Comparison Program, intending to show the country\u2019s annual average cost for commonly consumed foods being sold in multiple countries. Food item availability\
    \ and price at any one time and place could differ from this average. Also, prices are reported in local currency units, and then adjusted for inflation over time and price levels across countries using\
    \ national Consumer Price Indexes and Purchasing Power Parity exchange rates that may not exactly match currency values used in any one time and place.\n\n_Statistical concept and methodology_\n\nThe\
    \ Cost of a Healthy Diet is a new kind of price index developed by the Food Prices for Nutrition project, based on matching item descriptions to food composition data then selecting the lowest cost\
    \ options to meet dietary requirements. The initial methods were first published as a background paper for the UN agencies\u2019 State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report 2020 and revised\

  description: 'This dataset is based on the methodology developed in Herforth et al. (2022), which is a background paper for the UN agencies'' annual report on The State of Food Security and Nutrition
    in the World 2022 (https://www.fao.org/publications/sofi). It is based on data on prices for locally available food items from the World Bank''s International Comparison Program (ICP) (https://icp.worldbank.org/)
    matched to other data on food composition and dietary requirements.


    The nutritional requirements used in this study are in line with the WHO''s recommendations for the median woman of reproductive age. The authors note two key two reasons for this:

    (1) Requirements fall roughly at the median of the entire population distribution, in the sense that least-cost diets to meet energy and nutrient requirements for people in this reference group approximate
    the median level of least costs for all sex-age groups over the entire life cycle. This reference group is therefore a good representation of the population as a whole.

    (2) Women of reproductive age are typically a nutritionally vulnerable population group, as seen in their increased risk of dietary inadequacies (due to social practices and norms that often disadvantage
    them in terms of access to food), which have important consequences for themselves and their children. Previous studies have also based their analyses on this reference group.'

        description: >-
          The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $1 a day.


          The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the
          mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and
          expressed as a percentage of the poverty line.


          It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the
          amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall
          is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor
          – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.


          Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to
          whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty
          they experience.

          We calculate the total annual shortfall from the poverty line ('poverty gap') from estimates of the poverty gap
          index produced by the World Bank using the following formula: Total annual poverty gap = Poverty gap index x total
          population (including both poor and non-poor) x $2.15 x 365.

        title: $30 a day - poverty gap index
        description: >-
          The poverty gap index calculated at a poverty line of $30 a day.


          The poverty gap index is a measure that reflects both the depth and prevalence of poverty. It is defined as the
          mean shortfall of the total population from the poverty line counting the non-poor as having zero shortfall and
          expressed as a percentage of the poverty line.


          It is worth unpacking that definition a little. For those below the poverty line, the shortfall corresponds to the
          amount of money required in order to reach the poverty line. For those at or above the poverty line, the shortfall
          is counted as zero. The average shortfall is then calculated across the total population – both poor and non-poor
          – and then expressed as a share of the poverty line.


          Unlike the more commonly-used metric of the headcount ratio, the poverty gap index is thus sensitive not only to
          whether a person’s income falls below the poverty line or not, but also by how much – i.e. to the depth of poverty
          they experience.

          This is the amount of money that would be theoretically needed to lift the income or expenditure of all people in
          poverty up to the poverty line. However this is not a measure of the actual cost of eliminating poverty, since it
          does not take into account the costs involved in making the necessary transfers nor any changes in behaviour they
          would bring about.

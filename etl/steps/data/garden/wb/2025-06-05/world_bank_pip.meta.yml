    <% if welfare_type in ["income", "consumption"] %>
    To construct a global dataset, the World Bank combines estimates based on income data and estimates based on consumption data. Here we only include the estimates based on <<welfare_type>> data.
    <%- elif welfare_type == "income or consumption" %>
    For most countries in the PIP dataset, estimates relate to _either_ disposable income or consumption, for all available years. A number of countries, however, have a mix of income and consumption data points, with both data types sometimes available for particular years.

    In most of our charts, we present the data with some data points dropped in order to present single series for each country. This allows us to make readable visualizations that combine multiple countries and metrics. In choosing which data points to drop, we try to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. As such, the exact approach varies somewhat across countries.

    If you would like to see the original data with _all_ available income and consumption data points shown separately, you can do so in our [Poverty Data Explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/poverty-explorer?Indicator=Share+in+poverty&Poverty+line=%2410+per+day&Household+survey+data+type=Show+data+from+both+income+and+consumption+surveys&Show+breaks+between+less+comparable+surveys=true&country=ROU~CHN~BLR~PER).
    <%- endif %>

  description_processing_surveys_past_decade: |-
    For a small number of country-year observations, the World Bank PIP data contains two estimates: one based on income data and one based on consumption data. In these cases we keep only one of the estimates, to strike a balance between maintaining comparability over time and showing as long a time series as possible. This means the indicator is estimating the number of years at least one survey was conducted in the past decade, rather than the number of surveys.

  description_processing_relative_poverty: |-
    <% if poverty_line in ["40% of the median", "50% of the median", "60% of the median"] %>
    Measures of relative poverty are not directly available in the World Bank PIP data. To calculate this metric we take the median income or consumption for the country and year, calculate a relative poverty line – in this case <<poverty_line>> – and then run a specific query on the PIP API to return the share of population below that line.
    <%- endif %>

  description_processing_thr: |-
    Income and consumption thresholds by decile are not directly available in the World Bank PIP API. We extract the metric primarily from [auxiliary percentiles data provided by the World Bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0063646). Missing country values and regional aggregations of the indicator are calculated by running multiple queries on the API to obtain the closest poverty line to each threshold.

  # NOTE: Modify depending on the final data structure
  description_processing_share_90_99: |-
    The income share of the population between the 90th and 99th percentiles is not directly available in the World Bank PIP API. We calculate the metric by subtracting the share of the population in the 99th percentile (available in the percentile files [provided by the World Bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0063646/_poverty_and_inequality_platform_pip_percentiles)) from the share of the population in the 90th percentile (available in the API).

  description_processing_avg: |-
    Income and consumption averages by decile are not directly available in the World Bank PIP API. We calculate the metric by multiplying the share of each decile by the mean income or consumption of the distribution and dividing by the population share of the decile (10%).

  description_processing_thr_percentiles: |-
    We calculate missing country and regional values of thresholds by running multiple queries on the API to obtain the closest poverty line to each threshold. This data is merged with the percentile files [provided by the World Bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0063646/_poverty_and_inequality_platform_pip_percentiles).

          The poverty headcount ratio at societal poverty line is the percentage of a population living in poverty according to the World Bank's Societal Poverty Line. The Societal Poverty Line is expressed in purchasing power adjusted <<ppp_version>> U.S. dollars and defined as max({definitions.poverty_line}, {definitions.societal_poverty_line_intercept} + 0.5*Median). This means that when the national median is sufficiently low, the Societal Poverty line is equivalent to the extreme poverty line, {definitions.poverty_line}. For countries with a sufficiently high national median, the Societal Poverty Line grows as countries’ median income grows.

          The Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. A Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentages of total income received against the cumulative number of recipients, starting with the poorest individual or household. The Gini index measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a percentage of the maximum area under the line. Thus, a Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.

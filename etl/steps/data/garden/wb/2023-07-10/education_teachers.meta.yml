          Share of newly recruited public upper secondary school teachers who have been trained. A trained teacher is defined
          as "a teacher who has received at least the minimum organized teacher-training (pre-service or in-service) required
          for teaching at the relevant level". However, since minimum standards of training can vary greatly between countries,
          these indicators are often not directly comparable. Data available for African countries only. For more information,

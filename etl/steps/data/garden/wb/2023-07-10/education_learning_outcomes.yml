          text and rhetorical structures become more central to successfully completing tasks, especially navigating complex
          digital texts. Tasks require the respondent to identify, interpret, or evaluate one or more pieces of information,

          reflective tasks require readers to demonstrate a fine understanding of the text in relation to familiar, everyday

          knowledge. 2000, 2003, and 2006 PISA assessments used a different reading proficiency scale (Levels 1 to 5) than

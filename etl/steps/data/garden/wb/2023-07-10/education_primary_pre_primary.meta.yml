          Total number of students of the official primary school age group who are enrolled at primary or secondary education,
          expressed as a percentage of the corresponding population. Divide the total number of students in the official primary
          school age range who are enrolled in primary or secondary education by the population of the same age group and
          multiply the result by 100. NERA should be based on total enrolment of the official primary school participation
          age group in primary and secondary education for all types of schools and education institutions, including public,
          private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes (pre-primary education must be
          excluded). NERA gives more precise measure of the participation of the official primary school age population to
          the education system (excluding pre-primary education). It reflects the actual level of achievement of the Universal
          Primary Education (UPE) goal. In fact, while the Net enrolment rate (NER) shows the coverage of pupils in the official
          primary school age group in the primary education level only, the NERA extends the measure to those of the official
          primary school age range who have reached secondary education because they might access primary education earlier
          than the official entrance or they might skip some grades due to their performance. Increasing NERA might mirror
          improving participation of children in the official primary school age, the decrease of the target population or
          both. A value of 100% indicates theoretically that the country has accomplished the UPE goal. However, this condition
          is not sufficient for UPE due to, for example, a high repetition rate, which might lead pupils to dropout after
          primary school age without completing primary education. The difference between NERA and NER provides a measure
          of the proportion of children in the official primary age group who are enrolled in secondary education.

          A high NER denotes a high degree of coverage for the official school-age population. The theoretical maximum value
          is 100%. Increasing trends can be considered as reflecting improving coverage at the specified level of education.
          When the NER is compared with the GER, the difference between the two highlights the incidence of under-aged and
          over-aged enrolment. If the NER is below 100%, then the complement, i.e. the difference with 100%, provides a measure
          of the proportion of children not enrolled at the specified level of education. However, since some of these children/youth
          could be enrolled at other levels of education, this difference should in no way be considered as indicating the
          percentage of students not enrolled. To measure universal primary education, for example, adjusted primary NER is
          calculated on the basis of the percentage of children in the official primary school age range who are enrolled
          in either primary or secondary education. A more precise complementary indicator is the Age-specific enrolment ratio

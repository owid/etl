          Labor force comprises people ages 15 and older who supply labor for the production of goods and services during
          a specified period. It includes people who are currently employed and people who are unemployed but seeking work
          as well as first-time job-seekers. Not everyone who works is included, however. Unpaid workers, family workers,
          and students are often omitted, and some countries do not count members of the armed forces. Labor force size tends
          to vary during the year as seasonal workers enter and leave.

  description: The World Bank EdStats All Indicator Query holds over 4,000 internationally comparable indicators that describe
    education access, progression, completion, literacy, teachers, population, and expenditures. The indicators cover the
    education cycle from pre-primary to vocational and tertiary education.The query also holds learning outcome data from
    international and regional learning assessments (e.g. PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS), equity data from household surveys, and projection/attainment
    data to 2050. For further information, please visit the EdStats website.

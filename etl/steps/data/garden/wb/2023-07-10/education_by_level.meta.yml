    education access, progression, completion, literacy, teachers, population, and expenditures. The indicators cover the
    education cycle from pre-primary to vocational and tertiary education.The query also holds learning outcome data from
    international and regional learning assessments (e.g. PISA, TIMSS, PIRLS), equity data from household surveys, and projection/attainment
    data to 2050. For further information, please visit the EdStats website.

          private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes (pre-primary education must be
          excluded). NERA gives more precise measure of the participation of the official primary school age population to
          the education system (excluding pre-primary education). It reflects the actual level of achievement of the Universal
          Primary Education (UPE) goal. In fact, while the Net enrolment rate (NER) shows the coverage of pupils in the official
          primary school age group in the primary education level only, the NERA extends the measure to those of the official
          primary school age range who have reached secondary education because they might access primary education earlier
          than the official entrance or they might skip some grades due to their performance. Increasing NERA might mirror
          improving participation of children in the official primary school age, the decrease of the target population or
          both. A value of 100% indicates theoretically that the country has accomplished the UPE goal. However, this condition
          is not sufficient for UPE due to, for example, a high repetition rate, which might lead pupils to dropout after
          primary school age without completing primary education. The difference between NERA and NER provides a measure
          of the proportion of children in the official primary age group who are enrolled in secondary education.

        description: >
          Average number of students per Grade 7 class in public primary schools. Average class sizes differ from pupil-teacher
          ratios because average class sizes reflect the actual number of pupils taught by a teacher at a given time while
          the pupil-teacher ratio is a more global measure of the teaching resources available in schools. Pupil-teacher ratios
          are generally lower than average class sizes as teachers typically have additional non-teaching duties. The pupil-teacher
          ratio is useful for assessing the cost of providing education whereas class sizes are related to the classroom working
          conditions of teachers. Data available for African countries only. For more information, consult the UNESCO Institute

          of pupils who were enrolled in the final grade of the preceding cycle or level of education in the previous school
          year, and multiply by 100. High transition rates indicate a high level of access or transition from one level of
          education to the next. They also reflect the intake capacity of the next level of education. Inversely, low transition
          rates can signal problems in the bridging between two cycles or levels of education, due to either deficiencies
          in the examination system, or inadequate admission capacity in the higher cycle or level of education, or both.
          This indicator can be distorted by incorrect distinction between new entrants and repeaters, especially in the first
          grade of the specified higher level of education. Students who interrupted their studies for one or more years after
          having completed the lower level of education, together with the migrant students, could also affect the quality

          A high NER denotes a high degree of coverage for the official school-age population. The theoretical maximum value
          is 100%. Increasing trends can be considered as reflecting improving coverage at the specified level of education.
          When the NER is compared with the GER, the difference between the two highlights the incidence of under-aged and
          over-aged enrolment. If the NER is below 100%, then the complement, i.e. the difference with 100%, provides a measure
          of the proportion of children not enrolled at the specified level of education. However, since some of these children/youth
          could be enrolled at other levels of education, this difference should in no way be considered as indicating the
          percentage of students not enrolled. To measure universal primary education, for example, adjusted primary NER is
          calculated on the basis of the percentage of children in the official primary school age range who are enrolled
          in either primary or secondary education. A more precise complementary indicator is the Age-specific enrolment ratio
          (ASER) which shows the participation in education of the population of each particular age, regardless of the level
          of education.

          types of schools and education institutions, including public, private and all other institutions that provide organized
          educational programmes. A high NER denotes a high degree of coverage for the official school-age population. The
          theoretical maximum value is 100%. Increasing trends can be considered as reflecting improving coverage at the specified
          level of education. When the NER is compared with the GER, the difference between the two highlights the incidence
          of under-aged and over-aged enrolment. If the NER is below 100%, then the complement, i.e. the difference with 100%,
          provides a measure of the proportion of children not enrolled at the specified level of education. However, since
          some of these children/youth could be enrolled at other levels of education, this difference should in no way be
          considered as indicating the percentage of students not enrolled. To measure universal primary education, for example,
          adjusted primary NER is calculated on the basis of the percentage of children in the official primary school age
          range who are enrolled in either primary or secondary education. A more precise complementary indicator is the Age-specific
          enrolment ratio (ASER) which shows the participation in education of the population of each particular age, regardless
          of the level of education.

          for entry into vocational education, but that do not prepare for employment in a particular occupation or trade
          or class of occupations or trades, nor lead directly to a labour market relevant qualification.

          Total number of female students enrolled in vocational programmes at the lower secondary education level, expressed
          as a percentage of the total number of female students enrolled in all programmes (vocational and general) at the
          lower secondary level. Vocational education is designed for learners to acquire the knowledge, skills and competencies
          specific to a particular occupation or trade or class of occupations or trades. Vocational education may have work-based
          components (e.g. apprenticeships). Successful completion of such programmes leads to labour-market relevant vocational
          qualifications acknowledged as occupationally-oriented by the relevant national authorities and/or the labour market.

        description: >
          Number of years a person of school entrance age can expect to spend within the specified level of education. For
          a child of a certain age a, the school life expectancy is calculated as the sum of the age specific enrolment rates
          for the levels of education specified. The part of the enrolment that is not distributed by age is divided by the
          school-age population for the level of education they are enrolled in, and multiplied by the duration of that level
          of education. The result is then added to the sum of the age-specific enrolment rates. A relatively high SLE indicates
          greater probability for children to spend more years in education and higher overall retention within the education
          system. It must be noted that the expected number of years does not necessarily coincide with the expected number
          of grades of education completed, because of repetition. Since school life expectancy is an average based on participation
          in different levels of education, the expected number of years of schooling may be pulled down by the magnitude
          of children who never go to school. Those children who are in school may benefit from many more years of education
          than the average.

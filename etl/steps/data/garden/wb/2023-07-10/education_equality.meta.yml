          Typology of out-of-school children. Primary. Never in school. Male is the percentage of male out-of-school primary-school-age
          children who have never attended school and are not likely to enter school in the future. Since no survey can say
          definitively that a school-age person will never attend school, this is a probabilistic indicator. The indicator
          is based on UNESCO's methodology, which estimates the proportion of children who will never attend school as the
          proportion of out of school for the age group with the lowest proportion of out-of-school children. This methodology
          assumes no dropout before the age at which enrolment rates peak, and no late entry after the age with peak enrolment.

          Net attendance rate is the total number of students in the theoretical age group for lower secondary education attending
          that level, expressed as a percentage of the total population in that age group. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics
          (UIS) calculates household survey-based education indicators using data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)
          and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). School participation in household surveys and censuses is commonly
          measured by whether pupils or students attended a given grade or level of education at least one day during the
          academic reference year. Therefore, indicators of school participation derived from household survey data refer
          to attendance, e.g. "net attendance rate" or "adjusted net attendance rate". The comparable indicator for administrative
          data is "Net Enrolment Rate" because the data is based on numbers of students officially enrolled in educational
          institutions in the stated year. Each poverty quintile represents one fifth of students with quintile 1 being the
          poorest 20 percent of students and quintile 5 being the richest 20 percent of students. For more information, consult

          Net attendance rate is the total number of students in the theoretical age group for primary education attending
          that level, expressed as a percentage of the total population in that age group. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics
          (UIS) calculates household survey-based education indicators using data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)
          and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS). School participation in household surveys and censuses is commonly
          measured by whether pupils or students attended a given grade or level of education at least one day during the
          academic reference year. Therefore, indicators of school participation derived from household survey data refer
          to attendance, e.g. "net attendance rate" or "adjusted net attendance rate". The comparable indicator for administrative
          data is "Net Enrolment Rate" because the data is based on numbers of students officially enrolled in educational
          institutions in the stated year. Each poverty quintile represents one fifth of students with quintile 1 being the
          poorest 20 percent of students and quintile 5 being the richest 20 percent of students. For more information, consult

          and censuses is commonly measured by whether pupils or students attended a given grade or level of education at
          least one day during the academic reference year. Therefore, indicators of school participation derived from household
          survey data refer to attendance, e.g. "net attendance rate" or "adjusted net attendance rate". The comparable indicator
          for administrative data is "Total net enrolment rate, lower secondary" because the data is based on numbers of students
          officially enrolled in educational institutions in the stated year. Each poverty quintile represents one fifth of
          students with quintile 1 being the poorest 20 percent of students and quintile 5 being the richest 20 percent of
          students. For more information, consult the UIS website: http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/'

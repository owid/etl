    PISA dataset includes data on the educational attainment of 15-year-olds and their ability to use their reading, mathematics
    and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges.


    The Harmonized Learning Outcomes (HLO) database addresses the need for globally comparable learning metrics to track human
    capital formation. While international achievement tests are mainly administered in high-income countries, limiting insights
    into low- and middle-income nations, the HLO database fills this gap. It provides a comprehensive and regularly updated
    dataset covering 164 countries from 2000 to 2017. The dataset encompasses 98% of the global population, with a focus on
    developing economies, which make up two-thirds of the included countries.

          of trained teachers at the same level. A trained teacher is defined as a teacher who has fulfilled at least the
          minimum organized teacher-training requirements (pre-service or in-service) to teach a specific level of education
          according to the relevant national policy or law. These requirements usually include pedagogical knowledge (broad
          principles and strategies of classroom management and organization that transcend the subject matter being taught
          - typically approaches, methods and techniques of teaching), and professional knowledge (knowledge of statutory
          instruments and other legal frameworks that govern the teaching profession). Some programmes may also cover content
          knowledge (knowledge of the curriculum and the subject matter to be taught and the use of relevant materials). In
          computing and interpreting this indicator, one should take into account the existence of part-time teaching, school-shifts,
          multi-grade classes and other practices that may affect the precision and meaningfulness of pupil-teacher ratios.
          When feasible, the number of part-time teachers is converted to 'full-time equivalent' teachers; a double-shift
          teacher is counted twice, etc. Teachers are defined as persons whose professional activity involves the transmitting
          of knowledge, attitudes and skills that are stipulated in a formal curriculum programme to students enrolled in
          a formal educational institution.

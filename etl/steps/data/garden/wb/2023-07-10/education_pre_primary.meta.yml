    PISA dataset includes data on the educational attainment of 15-year-olds and their ability to use their reading, mathematics
    and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges.


    The Harmonized Learning Outcomes (HLO) database addresses the need for globally comparable learning metrics to track human
    capital formation. While international achievement tests are mainly administered in high-income countries, limiting insights
    into low- and middle-income nations, the HLO database fills this gap. It provides a comprehensive and regularly updated
    dataset covering 164 countries from 2000 to 2017. The dataset encompasses 98% of the global population, with a focus on
    developing economies, which make up two-thirds of the included countries.

        title: Expected years of schooling
        unit: years
        description_from_producer: |-
          Expected years of school is calculated as the sum of age-specific enrollment rates between ages 4 and 17. Age-specific enrollment rates are approximated using school enrollment rates at different levels: pre-primary enrollment rates approximate the age-specific enrolment rates for 4 and 5 year-olds; the primary rate approximates for 6-11 year-olds; the lower-secondary rate approximates for 12-14 year-olds; and the upper-secondary approximates for 15-17 year-olds. Most recent estimates are used.  Year of most recent primary enrollment rate used is shown in data notes.

        description_from_producer: |-
          Literacy is defined as the ability to understand, evaluate, use and engage with written texts to participate in society, to achieve one’s goals, and to develop one’s knowledge and potential. Literacy encompasses a range of skills from the decoding of written words and sentences to the comprehension, interpretation, and evaluation of complex texts. It does not, however, involve the production of text (writing). Information on the skills of adults with low levels of proficiency is provided by an assessment of reading components that covers text vocabulary, sentence comprehension and passage fluency. The target population for the survey was the non institutionalized population, aged 16-65 years, residing in the country at the time of data collection, irrespective of nationality, citizenship or language status. Literacy-related non-respondents are not included in the calculation of the mean scores which, thus, present an upper bound of the estimated literacy proficiency of the population.

        description_from_producer: |-
          Salaries after 10 years of experience refer to the scheduled annual salary of a full-time classroom teacher with the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified plus 10 years of experience. Salaries are in equivalent USD converted using PPPs for private consumption. Statutory salaries refer to scheduled salaries according to official pay scales, while actual salaries refer to the average annual salary earned by a full-time teacher. The salaries reported are gross (total sum paid by the employer) less the employer’s contribution to social security and pension, according to existing salary scales. Salaries are “before tax”, i.e. before deductions for income tax. Teachers’ salaries are one component of teachers’ total compensation. Other benefits, such as regional allowances for teaching in remote areas, family allowances, reduced rates on public transport and tax allowances on the purchase of cultural materials, may also form part of teachers’ total remuneration. There are also large differences in taxation and social-benefits systems in OECD countries. All this should be borne in mind when comparing statutory salaries across countries. Data after 2009 is not comparable to data for 2009 and before due to changes in methodology. For more information, consult the OECD's Education at a Glance website: http://www.oecd.org/edu/eag.htm

          Total general (local, regional and central) government expenditure on education (current, capital, and transfers), expressed as a percentage of GDP. It includes expenditure funded by transfers from international sources to government. Divide total government expenditure for a given level of education (ex. primary, secondary, or all levels combined) by the GDP, and multiply by 100. A higher percentage of GDP spent on education shows a higher government priority for education, but also a higher capacity of the government to raise revenues for public spending, in relation to the size of the country's economy. When interpreting this indicator however, one should keep in mind in some countries, the private sector and/or households may fund a higher proportion of total funding for education, thus making government expenditure appear lower than in other countries.

          Percentage of the population between age 25 and age 64 who can, with understanding, read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life. Generally, ‘literacy’ also encompasses ‘numeracy’, the ability to make simple arithmetic calculations. This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of literates aged 25-64 years by the corresponding age group population and multiplying the result by 100.

          **Historical literacy data:**

          The historical estimates in this long-run cross-country dataset were derived from a blend of diverse sources, each contributing to different time periods. For data before 1800, the dataset relies on the work of Buringh and Van Zanden (2009), which offers insights into literacy through the lens of manuscript and book production in Europe from the sixth to the eighteenth centuries. For the years 1820 and 1870 (excluding the United States), it incorporates data from Broadberry and O'Rourke's "The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe." The United States data comes from the National Center for Education Statistics. Additionally, global estimates for the period 1820-2000 are drawn from van Zanden and colleagues’ "How Was Life?: Global Well-being since 1820," an OECD publication. For historical estimates specific to Latin America, the dataset uses the Oxford Latin American Economic History Database (OxLAD). Each source follows a consistent conceptual definition of literacy, although discrepancies among sources are acknowledged, necessitating cautious interpretation of year-to-year changes. The dataset also includes instances where specific sources were preferred, such as opting for OxLAD data over the World Bank for Paraguay in 1982 due to significant differences in literacy rate estimates.

        title: Public spending on education as a share of GDP
        unit: "%"
        description_short: Total general government expenditure on education (all levels of government and all levels of education), given as a share of GDP.

          **Historical expenditure data:**

          Historical data in this dataset is based on a wide array of sources, reflecting a comprehensive approach to data collection across different time periods and regions. However, the diverse nature of these sources leads to inconsistencies, as methodologies and data quality vary between sources. For instance, older sources like the League of Nations Statistical Yearbook or Mitchell's 1962 data may use different metrics or collection methods compared to more modern sources like the OECD Education reports or UN surveys. This variance in source material and methodology means that direct comparisons across different years or countries might be challenging, necessitating careful interpretation and cross-reference for accuracy. The dataset serves as a rich historical repository but also underscores the complexities and challenges inherent in compiling and harmonizing historical data from multiple, diverse sources.

          **Recent estimates:**

          General government expenditure on education (current, capital, and transfers) is expressed as a percentage of GDP. It includes expenditure funded by transfers from international sources to government. General government usually refers to local, regional and central governments.

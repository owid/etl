    <% if povertyline == 300 %>
    Extreme poverty here is defined as living below the International Poverty Line of {definitions.poverty_line} per day.
    <%- elif povertyline == 420 %>
    A poverty line of {definitions.poverty_line} a day represents definitions of national poverty lines in lower-middle-income countries.
    <%- elif povertyline == 830 %>
    A poverty line of {definitions.poverty_line} a day represents definitions of national poverty lines in upper-middle-income countries.
    <%- endif %>

  description_key_ppp: |-
    The data is measured in international-$ at {definitions.ppp_year} prices â€“ this adjusts for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries.

  description_key_income_consumption: |-
    Depending on the country and year, the data relates to income (measured after taxes and benefits) or to consumption, per capita. _Per capita_ means that the income of each household is attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).

  description_key_nonmarket_income: |-
    Non-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.

  description_key_scenarios: |-
    This data combines data based on household surveys or extrapolated up until the year of the data release using GDP per capita growth estimates and forecasts, with projections from 2026-2030 based on GDP per capita growth projections from the World Bank's Macro Poverty Outlook (April 2025) together with IMF's World Economic Outlook (April 2025). For the period 2031-2050, the data is projected using the average annual historical GDP per capita growth over 2014-2023.

    # Original description:
    # The indicator expresses the percentage of the total population unable to afford an energy sufficient diet in a given country and year. A diet is considered unaffordable when the diet cost plus expenditures for basic non-food needs exceed income per capita per day. The expenditures for basic non-food needs are calculated as average non-food expenditure shares of low-income consumer multiplied by internaitonal poverty lines set by the World Bank. The non-food expenditure share is 37% and 44% in low-income and lower-middle-income countries for the second quintile of consumers, and 54% in upper-middle-and-high-income countries for the first quintile of consumers, according to household surveys compiled by the World Bank. The international poverty lines are $2.15/day for low-income countries, $3.65/day for lower-middle-income countries, $6.85/day for upper-middle-income countries, and $24.36/day for high-income countries, in 2017PPP$. Countries' income classifications follow the calendar year of 2021 standard (fiscal year of 2023 of the World Bank), which is the base year of the latest ICP cycle. Income data are provided by the World Bank’s Poverty and Inequality Platform. A value of zero indicates a null or a small number rounded down at the current precision level.
    - Non-food expenses are estimated by looking at how much low-income people typically spend on things like housing, clothing, and transportation.
    - This amount is calculated as the average share of non-food expenditure for a low-income consumer, multiplied by the international poverty line.
    - "The average share of non-food expenditure is based on the spending habits of specific income groups (quintiles):

      - In upper-middle-income and high-income countries, the first quintile of consumers is considered (the poorest 20% of consumers), where people spend around 54% of their income on non-food needs.

      - In low-income and lower-middle-income countries, the second quintile is considered (the second lowest 20% of consumers), where people spend about 37% and 44% of their income on non-food needs, respectively."
    - "The international poverty lines (in [international-$](#dod:int_dollar_abbreviation) at 2017 prices) are:

      - For low-income countries: $2.15/day.

      - For lower-middle-income countries: $3.65/day.

      - For upper-middle-income countries: $6.85/day.

      - For high-income countries: $24.36/day."
    - A value of zero indicates a null or a small number rounded down at the current precision level.

    # Original description:
    # The ratio of the cost of an energy sufficient diet to the food poverty lines, defined as $1.35/day for low-income countries (63% of the international poverty line of $2.15/day in 2017 PPP$), $2.04/day for lower-middle-income countries (56% of the international poverty line of $3.65/day in 2017 PPP$), $3.15/day for upper-middle-income countries (46% of the international poverty line of $6.85/day in 2017 PPP$), and $11.2/day (46% of the international poverty line of $24.36/day in 2017 PPP$). The percentages (63%, 56%, and 46%) represent the average food expenditure shares in the second quintile of consumers in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, and the first quintile of consumers in upper-middle-and-high-income countries, according to household surveys compiled by the World Bank. Countries' income classifications follow the calendar year of 2021 standard (fiscal year of 2023 of the World Bank), which is the base year of the latest ICP cycle.
    - "Poverty lines are defined (in [international-$](#dod:int_dollar_abbreviation) at 2017 prices) as follows:

      - For low-income countries, $1.35/day (63% of the international poverty line of $2.15/day).

      - For lower-middle-income countries, $2.04/day (56% of the international poverty line of $3.65/day).

      - For upper-middle-income countries, $3.15/day (46% of the international poverty line of $6.85/day).

      - For high-income countries, $11.2/day (46% of the international poverty line of $24.36/day)."
    - These percentages (63%, 56%, and 46%) represent the average food expenditure shares in the first quintile (the poorest 20th of the population) of consumers in upper-middle-income and high-income countries, and the second quintile of consumers in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, according to household surveys compiled by the World Bank.
  # Original descriptions (from https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/icp/brief/foodpricesfornutrition#3):
  # - Cost of a Healthy Diet: A healthy diet meets nutritional standards set by dietary guidelines, with sufficient diversity and quantity within and between food groups to achieve nutrient adequacy and protect against diet-related diseases. To measure access and affordability, the cost of meeting food-based dietary guidelines is computed using the least expensive foods available in each category at each place and time (see "Methods and options to monitor the cost and affordability of a healthy diet globally" and "Brief note: Methods and data sources" (Herforth et al. 2022) ). The cost of a healthy diet is the preferred indicator of diet costs as it uses the most affordable foods available at local markets to meet dietary needs for an active and healthy life, using standards adopted by national governments around the world. Total cost per day can be disaggregated by food group, showing the cost per day of the least expensive locally available items in each food group (fruits; vegetables; starchy staples; animal-source foods; legumes, nuts, and seeds; and oils and fats)
  # - Cost of a Nutrient Adequate Diet: A nutrient adequate diet meets all essential nutrient requirements, with sufficient diversity and quantity of locally available foods to stay within the upper and lower bounds for total protein, fats, and carbohydrates as well as essential vitamins and minerals required to avoid nutrient deficiencies or toxicity. Computation of the least-cost nutrient adequate diet requires linear programming optimization modeling, and is based on nutrient requirements only, rather than food groups specified in dietary guidelines.
  # - Cost of an Energy Sufficient Diet: An energy sufficient diet provides enough of a starchy staple food for day-to-day subsistence, without either nutrient adequacy or adherence to dietary guidelines. The least-cost version of this subsistence diet uses the most affordable locally available starchy staple, achieving energy balance but not nutrient adequacy or other dietary needs.

    The Cost of a Healthy Diet indicator provides a globally standardized metric to monitor food environments,  measuring a population’s access to sufficient food for an active and healthy life. For this metric, access to healthy diets is measured using the least expensive locally available items in sufficient quantities to meet national governments’ food-based dietary guidelines.  For global monitoring, commonalities among those guidelines are represented by a Healthy Diet Basket, specifying a target number and quantity of eleven items balanced across six nutritionally defined food groups. The items selected in each country to meet the global Healthy Diet Basket standard generally also achieve nutrient adequacy, at a similar cost to meeting an individual country’s own national dietary guidelines.

    _Limitations and exceptions_

    Item prices for the global Cost of a Healthy Diet indicator are reported by each national statistical organization through the International Comparison Program, intending to show the country’s annual average cost for commonly consumed foods being sold in multiple countries. Food item availability and price at any one time and place could differ from this average. Also, prices are reported in local currency units, and then adjusted for inflation over time and price levels across countries using national Consumer Price Indexes and Purchasing Power Parity exchange rates that may not exactly match currency values used in any one time and place.

    _Statistical concept and methodology_

    The Cost of a Healthy Diet is a new kind of price index developed by the Food Prices for Nutrition project, based on matching item descriptions to food composition data then selecting the lowest cost options to meet dietary requirements. The initial methods were first published as a background paper for the UN agencies’ State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report 2020 and revised for the 2022 and 2024 editions of that same report.

  description: |-
    This dataset is based on the methodology developed in Herforth et al. (2022), which is a background paper for the UN agencies' annual report on The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2022 (https://www.fao.org/publications/sofi). It is based on data on prices for locally available food items from the World Bank's International Comparison Program (ICP) (https://icp.worldbank.org/) matched to other data on food composition and dietary requirements.

    The nutritional requirements used in this study are in line with the WHO's recommendations for the median woman of reproductive age. The authors note two key two reasons for this:
    (1) Requirements fall roughly at the median of the entire population distribution, in the sense that least-cost diets to meet energy and nutrient requirements for people in this reference group approximate the median level of least costs for all sex-age groups over the entire life cycle. This reference group is therefore a good representation of the population as a whole.
    (2) Women of reproductive age are typically a nutritionally vulnerable population group, as seen in their increased risk of dietary inadequacies (due to social practices and norms that often disadvantage them in terms of access to food), which have important consequences for themselves and their children. Previous studies have also based their analyses on this reference group.

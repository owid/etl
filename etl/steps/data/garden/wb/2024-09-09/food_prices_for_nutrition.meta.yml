    # Original description:
    # The indicator expresses the percentage of the total population unable to afford an energy sufficient diet in a given country and year. A diet is considered unaffordable when the diet cost plus expenditures for basic non-food needs exceed income per capita per day. The expenditures for basic non-food needs are calculated as average non-food expenditure shares of low-income consumer multipled by internaitonal poverty lines set by the World Bank. The non-food expenditure share is 37% and 44% in low-income and lower-middle-income countries for the second quintile of consumers, and 54% in upper-middle-and-high-income countries for the first quintile of consumers, according to household surveys compiled by the World Bank. The international poverty lines are $2.15/day for low-income countries, $3.65/day for lower-middle-income countries, $6.85/day for upper-middle-income countries, and $24.36/day for high-income countries, in 2017PPP$. Countries' income classifications follow the calendar year of 2021 standard (fiscal year of 2023 of the World Bank), which is the base year of the latest ICP cycle. Income data are provided by the World Bankâ€™s Poverty and Inequality Platform. A value of zero indicates a null or a small number rounded down at the current precision level.
    - Non-food expenses are estimated by looking at how much low-income people typically spend on things like housing, clothing, and transportation.
    - "This amount is calculated as: [Average share of non-food expenditure for a low-income consumer] x [International poverty line]."
    - "The average share of non-food expenditure is based on the spending habits of specific income groups (quintiles):
      - In upper-middle-income and high-income countries, the first quintile of consumers is considered (the poorest 20% of consumers), where people spend around 54% of their income on non-food needs.
      - In low-income and lower-middle-income countries, the second quintile is considered (the second lowest 20% of consumers), where people spend about 37% and 44% of their income on non-food needs, respectively."
    - "The international poverty lines (in international dollars based on 2017 prices) are:
      - For low-income countries: $2.15/day.
      - For lower-middle-income countries: $3.65/day.
      - For upper-middle-income countries: $6.85/day.
      - For high-income countries: $24.36/day."
    - A value of zero indicates a null or a small number rounded down at the current precision level.

    # Original description:
    # The ratio of the cost of an energy sufficient diet to the food poverty lines, defined as $1.35/day for low-income countries (63% of the international poverty line of $2.15/day in 2017 PPP$), $2.04/day for lower-middle-income countries (56% of the international poverty line of $3.65/day in 2017 PPP$), $3.15/day for upper-middle-income countries (46% of the international poverty line of $6.85/day in 2017 PPP$), and $11.2/day (46% of the international poverty line of $24.36/day in 2017 PPP$). The percentages (63%, 56%, and 46%) represent the average food expenditure shares in the second quintile of consumers in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, and the first quintile of consumers in upper-middle-and-high-income countries, according to household surveys compiled by the World Bank. Countries' income classifications follow the calendar year of 2021 standard (fiscal year of 2023 of the World Bank), which is the base year of the latest ICP cycle.
    - "Poverty lines are defined (in international-$ in 2017 prices) as follows:
      - For low-income countries, $1.35/day (63% of the international poverty line of $2.15/day).
      - For lower-middle-income countries, $2.04/day (56% of the international poverty line of $3.65/day).
      - For upper-middle-income countries, $3.15/day (46% of the international poverty line of $6.85/day).
      - For high-income countries, $11.2/day (46% of the international poverty line of $24.36/day)."
    - These percentages (63%, 56%, and 46%) represent the average food expenditure shares in the second quintile of consumers in low-income and lower-middle-income countries, and the first quintile of consumers in upper-middle-and-high-income countries, according to household surveys compiled by the World Bank.

    This dataset is based on the methodology developed in Herforth et al. (2022), which is a background paper for the UN agencies' annual report on The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2022 (https://www.fao.org/publications/sofi). It is based on data on prices for locally available food items from the World Bank's International Comparison Program (ICP) (https://icp.worldbank.org/) matched to other data on food composition and dietary requirements.

    The nutritional requirements used in this study are in line with the WHO's recommendations for the median woman of reproductive age. The authors note two key two reasons for this:
    (1) Requirements fall roughly at the median of the entire population distribution, in the sense that least-cost diets to meet energy and nutrient requirements for people in this reference group approximate the median level of least costs for all sex-age groups over the entire life cycle. This reference group is therefore a good representation of the population as a whole.
    (2) Women of reproductive age are typically a nutritionally vulnerable population group, as seen in their increased risk of dietary inadequacies (due to social practices and norms that often disadvantage them in terms of access to food), which have important consequences for themselves and their children. Previous studies have also based their analyses on this reference group.

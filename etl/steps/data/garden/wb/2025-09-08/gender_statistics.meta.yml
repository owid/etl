   - This indicator combines the quantity and quality of education into a single measure.
   - It shows how many years of schooling in a high-performing system are equivalent to the education a student receives in their country.
   - The calculation multiplies expected years of schooling by a learning adjustment factor based on international test performance.
   - Countries are compared against a benchmark for advanced learning; higher-performing countries get higher adjustments, and lower-performing ones get lower adjustments.
   - It captures both access to schooling and learning effectiveness, showing whether students spend time in school productively.

        description_key:
          - This indicator is created by combining two specific types of parental leave. These components, together, provide a detailed understanding of the total leave available to mothers in relation to childbirth and early childcare.
          - The first component, the length of paid maternity leave, focuses on the leave specifically designated for mothers around the time of childbirth. This includes the days taken just before, during, and immediately after giving birth. The primary focus of this leave is on the mother's recovery and the essential bonding time with the newborn. It's a critical period that supports the mother's health and wellbeing, as well as the initial development of the child.
          - The second component, the length of paid parental leave for mother, includes days of parental leave that are specifically reserved for mothers. These are often defined by "use-it-or-lose-it" policies or mothers’ quotas. This part of the indicator represents additional support provided to mothers, extending beyond the traditional maternity leave period. It ensures that mothers have dedicated time for child-rearing and recovery, which cannot be transferred to fathers. This acknowledges the unique needs of mothers in the postnatal period and supports their role in early childcare.
          - The sum of these components reflects the total days of leave available specifically for the mother, emphasizing the support for maternal health and well-being.
          - This indicator uses standardized assumptions, like the woman having one child and residing in the largest business city, to ensure comparability, though this approach may not capture variations in laws affecting women in different states, rural areas, or minority groups

This leave plays a crucial role in supporting the father's engagement during the early stages of a child's life.

These are often defined by "use-it-or-lose-it" policies or fathers’ quotas.

        description_short: '"Work of equal value" means not just the same job, but also different jobs that are similar in skills, responsibilities, and working conditions.'
        description_key:
          - Equal pay for work of equal value" means that employees should be paid the same by their employer if their jobs require similar skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions, even if the jobs themselves are different. This is also called "pay equity.
          - Pay equity" goes further than "equal pay for equal work," which only ensures that employees in the same job get the same pay.
          - The value of different jobs can be measured by looking at factors like skills, effort, responsibility, and working conditions. However, proving that jobs are of equal value can be difficult because different roles may require different expertise, take place in different environments, or have historically been valued unequally.
          - For example, in the UK legal case of Julie Hayward v. Cammell Laird Shipbuilders (1988), a female cook argued that her job was just as valuable as those of male painters and joiners working in the shipyard, who were paid more. She won her case, but only after an independent expert carefully assessed the demands of each role.

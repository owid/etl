      For the current 2026 fiscal year, low-income economies are defined as those with a GNI per capita, calculated using the [World Bank Atlas method](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/378832-what-is-the-world-bank-atlas-method), of $1,135 or less in 2024; lower middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $1,136 and $4,495; upper middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita between $4,496 and $13,935; high-income economies are those with more than a GNI per capita of $13,935.

      Please note: Regions in this table include economies at all income levels. The term country, used interchangeably with economy, does not imply political independence but refers to any territory for which authorities report separate social or economic statistics.

    description_key:
      - The World Bank creates a yearly classification of countries by income, for all countries with population over 30,000.
      - This classification stays the same throughout the World Bank's fiscal year (from July 1 to June 30) even if the income data for a country changes.
      - Low-income countries are those with a gross national income (GNI) per capita of $1,135 or less in 2024.
      - Lower-middle-income countries are those with a GNI per capita between $1,136 and $4,495 in 2024.
      - Upper-middle-income countries are those with a GNI per capita between $4,496 and $13,935 in 2024.
      - High-income countries are those with a GNI per capita of more than $13,935 in 2024.
      - Venezuela, classified as an upper-middle income country until the fiscal year 2021, has been unclassified since then due to the unavailability of data. Ethiopia is currently in a temporary status of unclassification.

  description_processing_count_population: We count the countries in each income group and also calculate the total population in them by using a long-run dataset [maintained by Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources).

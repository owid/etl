    <% if poverty_line == 300 %>
    Extreme poverty here is defined as living below the International Poverty Line of {definitions.poverty_line} per day.
    <%- elif poverty_line == 420 %>
    A poverty line of {definitions.poverty_line} a day represents definitions of national poverty lines in lower-middle-income countries.
    <%- elif poverty_line == 830 %>
    A poverty line of {definitions.poverty_line} a day represents definitions of national poverty lines in upper-middle-income countries.
    <%- endif %>

  description_key_ppp: |-
    The data is measured in international-$ at {definitions.ppp_year} prices â€“ this adjusts for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries.

  description_key_income_consumption: |-
    Depending on the country and year, the data relates to income (measured after taxes and benefits) or to consumption, per capita. _Per capita_ means that the income of each household is attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).

  description_key_nonmarket_income: |-
    Non-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.

  description_key_scenarios: |-
    This data combines data based on household surveys or extrapolated up until the year of the data release using GDP growth estimates and forecasts, with projections based on GDP growth projections from the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects and the the Macro Poverty Outlook, together with IMF's World Economic Outlook, in the period 2025-2029. For 2030, the data is projected using the average annual historical GDP per capita growth over 2010-2019.

              Extreme poverty is defined as living below the International Poverty Line of
              $2.15 per day. This data is adjusted for inflation and for differences in the
              cost of living between countries.

              after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, [per capita](#dod:per-capita).

          - The data is measured in international-$ at 2017 prices â€“ this adjusts for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries.
          - Depending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita. 'Per capita' means that the income of each household is attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).
          - Non-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.

          PIP provides regional aggregate figures for the number of people living below the International Poverty Line. Unfortunately, for certain regions and years the data survey coverage is too low and the results are suppressed. From 1990 onwards, it is only for South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (on different years) that regional estimates are sometimes missing.

          For these years we calculate the number of poor in the region as the difference between the estimated total number of poor across the world and the sum of the number of poor across all other regions.

          Prior to 1990 estimates for more than one region are missing, precluding this method.

              $2.15 per day. This data is adjusted for inflation and for differences in the

          For a small number of country-year observations, the World Bank PIP data contains two estimates: one based on income data and one based on consumption data. In these cases we keep only the consumption estimate in order to obtain a single series for each country. This means the indicator is estimating the number of years at least one survey was conducted in the past decade, rather than the number of surveys.

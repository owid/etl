          - The data is measured in international-$ at 2017 prices â€“ this adjusts for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries.
          - Depending on the country and year, the data relates to income measured after taxes and benefits, or to consumption, per capita. 'Per capita' means that the income of each household is attributed equally to each member of the household (including children).
          - Non-market sources of income, including food grown by subsistence farmers for their own consumption, are taken into account.

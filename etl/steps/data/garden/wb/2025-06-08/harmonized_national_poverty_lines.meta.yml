        description_short: National poverty line used to construct global poverty lines representing low-income and middle-income countries. This data is adjusted for inflation and differences in living costs between countries.
        description_processing: We selected the most recent national poverty line for each country. The original dataset contained multiple poverty lines across different years, and, in the case of China, it also contained poverty lines for urban and rural regions.
        description_key:
          - This data is constructed from data available in World Bank datasets, and also from the European Statistical Office (Eurostat), the OECD, and some national statistical offices.
          - The original data comes usually as national poverty _rates_, and the authors select the closest poverty line available for this rate in the World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform. For more details on the methodology, please refer to [the original paper](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099503206032533226).
          - The resulting national poverty lines are used to construct global poverty lines in international dollars. The International Poverty Line, used to measure extreme poverty, is the median value among the harmonized national poverty lines in low-income countries. Similar calculations are made for lower- and upper-middle-income countries.
          - The data is measured in international-$ at 2021 prices – this adjusts for inflation and for differences in living costs between countries.

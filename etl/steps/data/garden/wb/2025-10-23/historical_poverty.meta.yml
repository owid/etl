      Historical poverty estimates (1820-1989) are generated by extrapolating modern income distributions backwards using GDP per capita growth rates from the Maddison Project Database.

      For each country, we start with the income distribution from the World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform (available from 1990 onwards, with 1000 quantiles per country-year) and apply year-by-year GDP growth rates in reverse to estimate historical income levels.

      When direct country-level GDP data is unavailable, we use a three-tier fallback strategy:
      1. Historical political entities (USSR, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia) for their successor states
      2. Regional GDP growth rates based on World Bank regional classifications

      The extrapolation assumes that relative income inequality within countries remained constant over time, which is a simplifying assumption necessary for long-run historical estimates.

    - Data is measured in international-$ at 2021 prices to adjust for inflation and differences in the cost of living between countries.
    - Historical estimates (before 1990) are extrapolated backwards using GDP per capita growth rates from the Maddison Project Database.
    - Modern estimates (1990 onwards) are based on the World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform with 1000 income quantiles per country.
    - The methodology assumes constant relative inequality within countries over time.

  title: Historical poverty estimates (World Bank and Maddison)
  description: |-
    This dataset combines modern income distribution data from the World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform with historical GDP per capita data from the Maddison Project Database to generate long-run poverty estimates from 1820 to the present.

    The methodology extrapolates income distributions backwards from 1990 (when detailed distributional data becomes available) to 1820, using actual historical GDP growth rates to adjust income levels while maintaining the shape of the income distribution.

          Historical data from van Zanden, J. et al. (2014) with estimates from 1870 to 2010 was combined with educational attainment estimates from Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capita.


          The Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capita projections are based on collected census and survey data for the base year (around 2010) and the Medium Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2) projection model. The SSP2 is a middle-of-the-road scenario that combines medium fertility with medium mortality, medium migration, and the Global Education Trend (GET) education scenario.

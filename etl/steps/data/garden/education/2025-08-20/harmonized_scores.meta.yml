      - Harmonized learning outcomes combine student test results into scores that can be compared across countries.
      - This data includes developing countries that are often missing from major international tests by incorporating regional assessments.
      - The data combines well-known international tests like [TIMSS, PIRLS](https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/), and [PISA](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/programmes/pisa.html) with regional tests like [SACMEQ](https://healtheducationresources.unesco.org/organizations/southern-and-eastern-africa-consortium-monitoring-educational-quality-sacmeq).
      - Test scores are adjusted using statistical methods so they can be compared fairly across different subjects, grade levels, and testing years.
      - This creates a dataset where countries can be compared on the same scale, accounting for differences in when tests were taken and what grades were tested.
      - The scoring system is based on TIMSS standards where 300 points represents basic skills and 625 points shows advanced performance.
      - Higher scores mean students in that country typically perform better on these academic tests, though the tests don't cover all subjects or age groups.

        description_short: The quality of schooling is assessed using the [harmonized learning scores](#dod:harmonized-scores), adjusted relative to the country with the highest performance, in this instance, Singapore.
        description_processing: Harmonized test scores are normalized to the country with the highest performance, in this case, Singapore. The normalization process involves dividing the country's score by the highest score.

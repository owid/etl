        title: Literacy rate in 1950
        description_short: Share of the population aged 15 and above who can read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life.
        description_processing: The source reports illiteracy data as ranges (e.g., 10–20%). These ranges were converted into point estimates by calculating their midpoint. For example, a range of 10–20% was converted to 15%.
      literacy_est:
        title: Literacy rate in 1950
        description_short: Share of the population aged 15 and above who can read and write a short, simple statement on their everyday life.
        description_processing: Literacy rates were not directly reported by the source. Instead, they were derived from illiteracy rates by subtracting the midpoint estimate of illiteracy from 100%. For example, an illiteracy range of 80–90% results in a literacy estimate of 10%.

          For each country and year, the share of the population aged 15 and older with no formal education was calculated. This involved summing up the population with no formal education and dividing it by the total population aged 15 and older for each country and year, then converting this ratio into a percentage.


          A global estimate was calculated for each year by summing the total population aged 15 and older across all countries and the total population within this age group with no formal education. The share of the global population aged 15+ with no formal education was then computed for each year.

The share of the global population aged 15+ with no formal education was then computed for each year.

          To calculate the share of the population with at least some basic education, the share of the population with no formal education was subtracted from 100%.

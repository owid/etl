      Historical data up to the year 1985 has been sourced from 'Human Capital in the Long Run' by Lee and Lee (2016). This historical data was then combined with recent estimates provided by the World Bank. For the period before 1985, regional aggregates were calculated by Our World in Data, using yearly population-weighted averages.

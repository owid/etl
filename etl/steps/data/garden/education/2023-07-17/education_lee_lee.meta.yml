      Historical data up to the year 1985 has been sourced from 'Human Capital in the Long Run' by Lee and Lee (2016). This historical data was then combined with recent estimates provided by the World Bank.


      For the period before 1985, regional aggregates were computed by Our World in Data through yearly population-weighted averages, where annual values are proportionally adjusted to emphasize the influence of larger populations.

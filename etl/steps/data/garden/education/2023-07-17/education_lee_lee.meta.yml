          Net enrollment rate for primary school is calculated by dividing the number of students of official
          school age enrolled in primary education by the population of the age group which officially corresponds to primary
          education, and multiplying by 100.


          Historical data up to the year 1985 has been sourced from 'Human Capital in the Long Run' by Lee and Lee (2016). This historical data was then combined with recent estimates provided by the World Bank. For the period before 1985, regional aggregates were calculated by Our World in Data, using yearly population-weighted averages.

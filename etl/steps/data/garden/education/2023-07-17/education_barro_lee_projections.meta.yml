  title: Projections of educational attainment 2015-2040 (Barro and Lee, 2015)
  description: >-
    Barro and Lee (2015): Using the estimates on school enrollment and population structure, Lee and Lee (2016) have constructed
    projections of educational attainment for the population, disaggregated by gender and age group (15-24, 25-64, and 15-64)
    for 146 countries from 2015 to 2040 at five-year intervals.

    They first use the 2010 data on educational attainment by age group as benchmark figures to project the educational attainment
    of the population by age group for the next three decades. They then estimate the distribution of educational attainment
    for the younger population, aged 15-24, at the five-year intervals from 2015 to 2040 and then forward-extrapolate the
    estimates to construct the distribution of educational attainment for the older population groups. For the population
    structure, they use existing U.N. projections. For the detailed explanation of the estimation method, see Barro and Lee
    (2015, chapter 3). Data can be accessed here: https://barrolee.github.io/BarroLeeDataSet/OUPProj.html

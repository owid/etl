  title: Historical numeracy and years of schooling estimates (Clio Infra)
  description: &desc >-
    This dataset contains historical estimates of average years of education and numeracy estimates.
    It also includes historical estimates of Gini coefficient of inequality in educational attainment (years of education) and Gini and gender coefficient of inequality for both educational attainment and numeracy.

          Ratio of girls to boys in average years of schooling by country and decade.


          Based on Barro and Lee (2010) who provide data on educational attainment disaggregated by age groups over 15 and by sex. The information on average years of education has been used to evaluate the progress that has been made in the second half of the 20th century in closing the gender gap regarding education. Their data and detailed information regarding their dataset can be accessed at: http://www.barrolee.com/


          Data on school attainment comes from census/survey figures, which report the distribution of education in the population over age 15 by sex.

      numeracy:
        title:  Historical numeracy estimates
        description: >-
          Age heaping refers to the tendency for age data collected in surveys or censuses to be disproportionately reported at certain "attractive" or "round" numbers. This phenomenon often manifests itself in ages being reported at numbers that end in 0 or 5.

          For example, when people are asked their age, they might be more likely to report it as 30, 35, 40, etc., rather than the exact age of 31, 36, or 39.

          The authors of this dataset use this “age heaping” to measure gender inequality in cognitive ability in quantitative reasoning, or “numeracy” and construct a database of age heaping-based estimates of basic numeracy with broad geographic and temporal coverage.

          The higher the measure of gender equality, the lower the share of women rounding up or down their age in comparison to men rounding up or down in a certain country. A positive (negative) gender equality index implies a female (male) numeracy advantage.

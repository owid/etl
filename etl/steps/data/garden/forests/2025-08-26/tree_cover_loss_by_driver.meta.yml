          Improvements in the detection of tree cover loss due to the incorporation of new satellite data and methodology changes between 2011 and 2015 may result in higher estimates of loss in recent years compared to earlier years.

      - Time-series gridded data (30m x 30m) of tree cover loss in areas where canopy density was greater than or equal to 30% in 2000 was extracted and cross-referenced with gridded data (10km x 10km) on the dominant driver of deforestation in each area, based on [Curtis et al 2018](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1108).
      - Individual grid cells may have more than one driver of tree cover loss, and drivers may vary over time.

      Long-term, permanent [tree cover loss](#dod:tree-cover-loss) for small- to large-scale agriculture.

      [Tree cover loss](#dod:tree-cover-loss)  due to the expansion and intensification of roads, settlements, urban areas, or other built infrastructure.
    <% elif category == "Shifting cultivation" %>
      [Tree cover loss](#dod:tree-cover-loss) due to small- to medium-scale clearing for temporary cultivation that is later abandoned and followed by subsequent regrowth of secondary forest or vegetation.
    <% elif category == "Wildfire" %>
      [Tree cover loss](#dod:tree-cover-loss) due to fire with no visible human conversion or agricultural activity afterward. Fires may be started by natural causes (e.g. lightning) or may be related to human activities (accidental or deliberate).

      This indicator is calculated by Our World in Data based on data from the Global Forest Watch. Time-series data of tree cover loss in areas of forest where tree canopy cover was greater than or equal to 30% in 2000 was extracted and cross-referenced with data on the dominant driver of deforestation in each area, based on [Curtis et al 2018](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1108). Values may be slightly different to those shown on Global Forest Watch due to differences in the country boundaries used.

      commodity_driven_deforestation:
        title: Tree cover loss driven by commodity-driven deforestation
        description_short: Tree cover loss from commodity-driven deforestation is typically large-scale deforestation linked primarily to commercial agricultural expansion.  This type of tree cover loss usually represents permanent deforestation.

      forestry:
        title: Tree cover loss driven by forestry
        description_short: Tree cover loss from forestry is typically temporary loss from plantation and natural forest harvesting, with some deforestation of primary forests. This type of tree cover loss usually represents temporary loss.

      shifting_agriculture:
        title: Tree cover loss driven by shifting agriculture
        description_short: Tree cover loss from shifting agriculture is typically temporary loss or permanent deforestation due to small- and medium-scale agriculture. This type of tree cover loss usually represents temporary loss.

      urbanization:
        title: Tree cover loss driven by urbanization
        description_short: Tree cover loss from urbanization is typically deforestation for expansion of urban centers. This type of tree cover loss usually represents permanent deforestation.

      wildfire:
        title: Tree cover loss driven by wildfire
        description_short: Tree cover loss from wildfire is typically temporary loss, it does not include fire clearing for agriculture. This type of tree cover loss usually represents temporary loss.

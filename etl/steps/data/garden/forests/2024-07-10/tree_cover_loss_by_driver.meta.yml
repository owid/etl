      This indicator is calculated by Our World in Data based on data from the Global Forest Watch. Time-series data of tree cover loss in areas of forest where tree canopy cover was greater than or equal to 30% in 2000 was extracted and cross-referenced with data on the dominant driver of deforestation in each area, based on [Curtis et al 2018](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1108). Values may be slightly different to those shown on Global Forest Watch due to differences in the country boundaries used.

  # General definitions.
  definition_disaster: &definition-disaster |-
    EM-DAT defines a disaster as a situation or event which overwhelms local capacity, necessitating a request to the national or international level for external assistance; an unforeseen and often sudden event that causes great damage, destruction, and human suffering.
  # Definitions of impact variables.
  definition_dead: &definition-dead |-
    EM-DAT counts deaths as deceased and missing people combined, as a result of a natural disaster.
  definition_injured: &definition-injured |-
    EM-DAT counts injured as people with physical injuries, trauma, or illness requiring immediate medical assistance due to the disaster.
  definition_homeless: &definition-homeless |-
    EM-DAT counts homeless as people requiring shelter due to their house being destroyed or heavily damaged during the disaster.
  definition_affected: &definition-affected |-
    Affected people are those requiring immediate assistance due to the disaster.
  definition_total_affected: &definition-total-affected |-
    The total number of affected people is the sum of those injured, affected, and left homeless after a disaster.
  definition_reconstruction_costs: &definition-reconstruction-costs |-
    Reconstruction cost is defined as the money needed to replace lost assets, unadjusted for inflation.
  definition_insured_damage: &definition-insured-damage |-
    Insured damage is defined as the economic cost covered by insurance companies, unadjusted for inflation.
  definition_total_damage: &definition-total-damage |-
    The total damage is defined as the value of all economic losses directly or indirectly due to the disaster, unadjusted for inflation.
  # Definition of processing.
  description_processing_per_100k: &description-processing-100k |-
    Disaster-related impacts from EM-DAT have been normalized by Our World in Data to provide data in terms of occurrences per 100,000 people.
  description_processing_per_gdp: &description-processing-gdp |-
    Our World in Data has calculated economic damage metrics adjusted for gross domestic product (GDP).
  # Definitions of disasters.
  definition_drought: &definition-drought |-
    Drought is defined as an extended period of unusually low precipitation that produces a shortage of water for people, animals, and plants. Drought is different from most other hazards in that it develops slowly, sometimes even over the years, and its onset is generally difficult to detect.
  # Drought is not solely a physical phenomenon because its impacts can be exacerbated by human activities and water supply demands. Drought is therefore often defined both conceptually and operationally. Operational definitions of drought, i.e., the degree of precipitation reduction that constitutes a drought, vary by locality, climate, and environmental sector.
  definition_earthquake: &definition-earthquake |-
    An earthquake is defined as a sudden movement of a block of the Earth's crust along a geological fault and associated ground shaking.
  definition_extreme_temperature: &definition-extreme-temperature |-
    Extreme temperature is used as a general term for temperature variations above (extreme heat) or below (extreme cold) normal conditions.
  definition_flood: &definition-flood |-
    Flood is used as a general term for the overflow of water from a stream channel onto normally dry land in the floodplain (riverine flooding), higher-than-normal levels along the coast (coastal flooding) and in lakes or reservoirs as well as ponding of water at or near the point where the rain fell (flash floods).
  # definition_landslide: &definition-landslide |-
  #   EM-DAT defines a landslide as any kind of moderate to rapid soil movement including lahars, mudslides, and debris flows (under dry conditions). A landslide is the movement of soil or rock controlled by gravity and the speed of the movement usually ranges between slow and rapid, but it is not very slow. It can be superficial or deep, but the materials must make up a mass that is a portion of the slope or the slope itself. The movement has to be downward and outward with a free face.
  # definition_storm: &definition-storm |-
  #   EM-DAT uses 'storm' as a general term for a disturbance in the atmosphere that results in strong winds accompanied by rain, snow, or other precipitation.
  definition_volcanic_eruption: &definition-volcanic-eruption |-
    Volcanic activity is defined as any type of volcanic event near an opening/vent in the Earth's surface including volcanic eruptions of lava, ash, hot vapor, gas, and pyroclastic material.
  definition_wildfire: &definition-wildfire |-
    A wildfire is defined as any uncontrolled and non-prescribed combustion or burning of plants in a natural setting such as a forest, grassland, brush land or tundra, which consumes natural fuels and spreads based on environmental conditions (e.g., wind, or topography). Wildfires can be triggered by lightning or human actions.
  definition_dry_mass_movement: &definition-dry-mass-movement |-
    A dry mass movement is defined as any type of downslope movement of earth materials under hydrological dry conditions.
  definition_wet_mass_movement: &definition-wet-mass-movement |-
    A wet mass movement is defined as a type of mass movement that occur when heavy rain or rapid snow/ice melt send large amounts of vegetation, mud, or rock down a slope driven by gravitational forces.
  definition_glacial_lake_outburst_flood: &definition-glacial-lake-outburst-flood |-
    Glacial lake outburst floods are defined as those that occur when water held back by a glacier or moraine is suddenly released. Glacial lakes can be at the front of the glacier (marginal lake) or below the ice sheet (sub-glacial lake).
  definition_fog: &definition-fog |-
    Fog is defined as water droplets that are suspended in the air near the Earth's surface. Fog is simply a cloud that is in contact with the ground. Currently, the only fog disaster recorded in EM-DAT is the Great Smog of London in 1952.

  # Definitions of event sizes, adapted from Guha-Sapir et al. (2004).
  definition_small_event: &definition-small-event |-
    A disaster is considered to have a "small" impact if it results in no more than 5 deaths, affects no more than 1,500 people, and causes economic damages not exceeding 13 million current US dollars. The economic threshold for previous years is adjusted for inflation accordingly.
  definition_large_event: &definition-large-event |-
    A disaster is considered to have a "large" impact if it results in more than 50 deaths, affects more than 150,000 people, or causes economic damages exceeding 320 million current US dollars. The economic threshold for previous years is adjusted for inflation accordingly.
  definition_medium_event: &definition-medium-event |-
    A disaster is considered to have a "medium" impact if it does not fall under the categories of "small" or "large".
  definition_unknown_event: &definition-unknown-event |-
    A disaster is considered to have an "unknown" impact if there is no data available on the number of deaths, affected people, or economic damages.
  definition_size_origin: &definition-size-origin |-
    These definitions on the relative impacts of natural disasters are adapted from Guha-Sapir et al. (2004), and were originally based on definitions by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED).

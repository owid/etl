  # General definitions.
  definition_disaster: &definition-disaster |-
    EM-DAT defines a disaster as a situation or event which overwhelms local capacity, necessitating a request to the national or international level for external assistance; an unforeseen and often sudden event that causes great damage, destruction, and human suffering.
  # Definitions of impact variables.
  definition_dead: &definition-dead |-
    EM-DAT counts deaths as deceased and missing people combined, as a result of a natural disaster.
  definition_injured: &definition-injured |-
    EM-DAT counts injured as people with physical injuries, trauma, or illness requiring immediate medical assistance due to the disaster.
  definition_homeless: &definition-homeless |-
    EM-DAT counts homeless as people requiring shelter due to their house being destroyed or heavily damaged during the disaster.
  definition_affected: &definition-affected |-
    EM-DAT defines affected as people requiring immediate assistance due to the disaster.
  definition_total_affected: &definition-total-affected |-
    EM-DAT defines total affected as the sum of the injured, affected, and left homeless after a disaster.
  definition_reconstruction_costs: &definition-reconstruction-costs |-
    EM-DAT defines reconstruction costs as the money needed to replace lost assets, unadjusted for inflation.
  definition_insured_damage: &definition-insured-damage |-
    EM-DAT defines insured damage as the economic cost covered by insurance companies, unadjusted for inflation.
  definition_total_damage: &definition-total-damage |-
    EM-DAT defines total damage as the value of all economic losses directly or indirectly due to the disaster, unadjusted for inflation.
  # Definition of processing.
  description_processing_per_100k: &description-processing-100k |-
    Disaster-related impacts from EM-DAT have been normalized by Our World in Data to provide data in terms of occurrences per 100,000 people.
  description_processing_per_gdp: &description-processing-gdp |-
    Our World in Data has calculated economic damage metrics adjusted for gross domestic product (GDP).
  # Definitions of disasters.
  definition_drought: &definition-drought |-
    EM-DAT defines drought as an extended period of unusually low precipitation that produces a shortage of water for people, animals, and plants. Drought is different from most other hazards in that it develops slowly, sometimes even over the years, and its onset is generally difficult to detect. Drought is not solely a physical phenomenon because its impacts can be exacerbated by human activities and water supply demands. Drought is therefore often defined both conceptually and operationally. Operational definitions of drought, i.e., the degree of precipitation reduction that constitutes a drought, vary by locality, climate, and environmental sector.
  definition_earthquake: &definition-earthquake |-
    EM-DAT defines an earthquake as a sudden movement of a block of the Earth's crust along a geological fault and associated ground shaking.
  definition_extreme_temperature: &definition-extreme-temperature |-
    EM-DAT uses 'extreme temperature' as a general term for temperature variations above (extreme heat) or below (extreme cold) normal conditions.
  definition_flood: &definition-flood |-
    EM-DAT uses 'flood' as a general term for the overflow of water from a stream channel onto normally dry land in the floodplain (riverine flooding), higher-than-normal levels along the coast (coastal flooding) and in lakes or reservoirs as well as ponding of water at or near the point where the rain fell (flash floods).
  # definition_landslide: &definition-landslide |-
  #   EM-DAT defines a landslide as any kind of moderate to rapid soil movement including lahars, mudslides, and debris flows (under dry conditions). A landslide is the movement of soil or rock controlled by gravity and the speed of the movement usually ranges between slow and rapid, but it is not very slow. It can be superficial or deep, but the materials must make up a mass that is a portion of the slope or the slope itself. The movement has to be downward and outward with a free face.
  # definition_storm: &definition-storm |-
  #   EM-DAT uses 'storm' as a general term for a disturbance in the atmosphere that results in strong winds accompanied by rain, snow, or other precipitation.
  definition_volcanic_eruption: &definition-volcanic-eruption |-
    EM-DAT defines volcanic activity as any type of volcanic event near an opening/vent in the Earth's surface including volcanic eruptions of lava, ash, hot vapor, gas, and pyroclastic material.
  definition_wildfire: &definition-wildfire |-
    EM-DAT defines a wildfire as any uncontrolled and non-prescribed combustion or burning of plants in a natural setting such as a forest, grassland, brush land or tundra, which consumes natural fuels and spreads based on environmental conditions (e.g., wind, or topography). Wildfires can be triggered by lightning or human actions.
  definition_dry_mass_movement: &definition-dry-mass-movement |-
    EM-DAT defines dry mass movement as any type of downslope movement of earth materials under hydrological dry conditions.
  definition_wet_mass_movement: &definition-wet-mass-movement |-
    EM-DAT defines wet mass movement as a type of mass movement that occur when heavy rain or rapid snow/ice melt send large amounts of vegetation, mud, or rock down a slope driven by gravitational forces.
  definition_glacial_lake_outburst_flood: &definition-glacial-lake-outburst-flood |-
    EM-DAT defines glacial lake outburst floods as those that occur when water held back by a glacier or moraine is suddenly released. Glacial lakes can be at the front of the glacier (marginal lake) or below the ice sheet (sub-glacial lake).
  definition_fog: &definition-fog |-
    EM-DAT defines fog as water droplets that are suspended in the air near the Earth's surface. Fog is simply a cloud that is in contact with the ground.
  # definition_extreme_weather: &definition-extreme-weather |-
  # I couldn't find any precise definition of extreme weather in the EM-DAT documentation: https://doc.emdat.be/docs/

          The variable indicates whether some citizens directly or indirectly elect the chief executive. It considers political system which do not govern themselves — such as due to external interventions, occupations, or colonization — as not holding executive elections.
        description_from_producer: |-
          Indicates whether the chief executive is either directly or indirectly elected (i.e., chosen by people who have been elected). This indicator takes into account whether executive power is responsible to an elected parliament if the executive is not directly elected, a situation generated by a series of historical and contemporary monarchies and principalities. Episodes of international supervision or domination following international interventions, occupation, or colonization, meaning that the polity does practice exercise self-government, are also understood as disqualifying. 1=present, 0=absent.

        description_from_producer: |-
          Indicates whether a legislative body, a parliament, issues at least some laws and does not perform executive functions. The lower house (or unicameral chamber) of the legislature is at least partly elected. The legislature has not been closed. 1=present, 0=absent.

          - It considers the incumbent changing after multi-party elections as a strong indicator, but neither necessary nor sufficient.
          - It does not consider whether all contestants have access to funding and the media, and media coverage is unbiased.
        description_from_producer: |-
          The chief executive offices and seats in the effective legislative body are filled by elections characterized by uncertainty, meaning that the elections are, in principle, sufficiently free to enable the opposition to gain power if they were to attract sufficient support from the electorate. This presumes that control over key executive and legislative offices is determined by elections, the executive and members of the legislature have not been unconstitutionally removed, and the legislature has not been dissolved. With respect to the electoral process, this presumes that the constitutional timing of elections has not been violated (in a more than marginal fashion), non- extremist parties are not banned, opposition candidates are generally free to participate, voters experience little systematic coercion in exercising their electoral choice, and electoral fraud does not determine who wins. With respect to the outcome, this presumes that the declared winner of executive and legislative elections reflects the votes cast by the electorate, as near as can be determined from extant sources. Incumbent turnover (as a result of multi-party elections) is regarded as a strong indicator of competition, but is neither necessary nor sufficient. In addition, we rely on reports from outside observers (as reported in books, articles, and country reports) about whether the foregoing conditions have been met in a given election. Coding for this variable does not take into account whether there is a level playing field, whether all contestants gain access to funding and media, whether media coverage is unbiased, whether civil liberties are respected, or other features associated with fully free and fair elections. 1=present, 0=absent.

          We operationalize electoral democracy as a series of necessary-and-sufficient conditions arrayed in an ordinal scale. The resulting Lexical Index of Electoral Democracy (LIED). In this fashion, we arrive at an index that performs a classificatory function, each level identifies a unique and theoretically meaningful regime type, as well as a discriminating function. To generate the lexical index from the six binary variables described above, a country-year is assigned scores (0 to 6) based on the following criteria:

          0: legislative_election=0 & executive_elections=0 (regime type: non-electoral autocracies)

          1: legislative_elections=1 or executive_elections=1 & multi-party_legislative_elections=0 (regime type: one-party autocracies, few cases where executive elections are on track but there is no functioning elected parliament)

          2: legislative_elections=1 & multi-party_legislative_elections=1 & executive_elections=0 (regime type: multiparty autocracies without elected executive – generally because a monarch influences government appointment and removal or foreign powers dominate political decision-making or has significant veto powers)

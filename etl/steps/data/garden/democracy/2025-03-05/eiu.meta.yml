  title: EIU Democratic Index (2006-2024)
  description: |-
    The Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) Democracy Index provides a snapshot of the state of democracy in 165 independent states and two territories. This covers almost the entire population of the world and the vast majority of the world's states (microstates are excluded). Scored on a 0-10 scale, the Democracy Index is based on five categories: electoral process and pluralism, functioning of government, political participation, political culture, and civil liberties. Based on its scores on a range of indicators within these categories, each country is classified as one of four types of regime: "full democracy", "flawed democracy", "hybrid regime" or "authoritarian regime".

    This dataset was constructed using data collected from various EIU yearly reports and a multi-year compilation by Gapminder.

        We source the data from Gapminder for the years 2006 to 2020, and directly from the Economist Intelligence Unit for more recent years.

        For the world as a whole and for each region (as [defined by us](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/continents-according-to-our-world-in-data)), we calculate both simple country averages and [population-weighted](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/democracy?country=OWID_WRL~OWID_AFR~OWID_ASI~OWID_EUR~OWID_NAM~OWID_OCE~OWID_SAM&Dataset=Economist+Intelligence+Unit&Metric=Electoral+democracy&Sub-metric=%C2%AD%C2%AD%C2%AD%C2%AD%C2%AD%C2%AD%C2%ADMain+index+weighted+by+population) averages. A population-weighted average assigns more weight to countries with larger populations, so that the results better reflect the experiences of the average person.

          Extent to which citizens can choose their political leaders in free and fair elections, enjoy civil liberties, prefer democracy over other political systems, can and do participate in politics, and have a functioning government that acts on their behalf.

          - This index, produced by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), is useful if you are interested in recent trends, want scores for almost all countries, and prefer a broad understanding of democracy. For data that covers the more distant past or focuses on more specific aspects of democracy, other sources will be more useful. You can explore these alternatives in our [Key Democracy Charts](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy#all-charts) and [Democracy Data Explorer](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/democracy?Dataset=Varieties+of+Democracy&Metric=Electoral+democracy&Sub-metric=Main+index&country=ARG~AUS~BWA~CHN~OWID_WRL).
          - |-
            It takes a broad view of democracy, by including several dimensions: electoral (free and fair elections), liberal (civil rights and protection from the state), participatory (citizens engage in elections), deliberative (citizens engage in civil society and public discourse), and effective (governments can act on citizens' behalf).
          - The index is based mainly on assessments by the EIUâ€™s country experts. It also uses representative surveys of regular citizens.
          - |-
            It is made up of five sub-indices: [electoral pluralism](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/democracy?Dataset=Economist+Intelligence+Unit&Metric=Electoral+democracy&Sub-metric=Electoral+pluralism+index&country=ARG~AUS~BWA~CHN~OWID_WRL), [civil liberties](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/democracy?Dataset=Economist+Intelligence+Unit&Metric=Electoral+democracy&Sub-metric=%C2%ADCivil+liberties+index&country=ARG~AUS~BWA~CHN~OWID_WRL), [political participation](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/democracy?Dataset=Economist+Intelligence+Unit&Metric=Electoral+democracy&Sub-metric=%C2%ADPolitical+participation+index&country=ARG~AUS~BWA~CHN~OWID_WRL), [democratic culture](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/democracy?Dataset=Economist+Intelligence+Unit&Metric=Electoral+democracy&Sub-metric=Democratic+culture+index&country=ARG~AUS~BWA~CHN~OWID_WRL), and [functioning government](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/democracy?Dataset=Economist+Intelligence+Unit&Metric=Electoral+democracy&Sub-metric=Functioning+government+index&country=ARG~AUS~BWA~CHN~OWID_WRL).
          - The index is also available as a [classification](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/democracy?Dataset=Economist+Intelligence+Unit&Metric=Electoral+democracy&Sub-metric=Political+regime&country=ARG~AUS~BWA~CHN~OWID_WRL) that groups countries into full democracies, flawed democracies, hybrid regimes, and authoritarian regimes.
          - |-
            **Why this matters:**

            - Democracy shapes how we live, how we can express our ideas, and how governments respond to our needs. Where it thrives, people enjoy more freedom, dignity, and security. Where it breaks down, they often face oppression, injustice, and instability.
            - A century ago, democracy existed in only a few countries. Today, most have built more open and accountable political systems. But progress is fragile: many still struggle to build stable democratic institutions.
            - This data shows how countries compare: where democracy is strong, where it is weak, and where more progress is needed.

              Data by the [Economist Intelligence Unit](#dod:economist-intelligence-unit). Expert estimates of the extent to which citizens can choose their political leaders in free and fair elections, enjoy civil liberties, prefer democracy over other political systems, can and do participate in politics, and have a functioning government that acts on their behalf. The index ranges from 0 to 10 (most democratic).

          Political regime of a country. It distinguishes between authoritarian regimes (score 0), hybrid regimes (score 1), flawed democracies (score 2), and full democracies (score 3).
        description_key:
          - Full democracies have comprehensive democratic features, with a high extent to which citizens can choose their political leaders in free and fair elections, enjoy civil liberties, prefer democracy over other political systems, can and do participate in politics, and have a functioning government that acts on their behalf.
          - Flawed democracies have some weaknesses in democratic institutions and culture.
          - Hybrid regimes have serious weaknesses in democratic institutions and culture.
          - Authoritarian regimes have few democratic institutions and little democratic culture.

          This is a binary indicator which we define as follows:

          * score 1: If `electprocess_fh >= 7`, `polrights_score_fh >= 20` and `civlibs_score_fh >= 30`.
          * score NA: If `electprocess_fh`, `polrights_score_fh` and `civlibs_score_fh` values are all missing.
          * score 0: Otherwise.

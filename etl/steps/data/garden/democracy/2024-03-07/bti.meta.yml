      democracy_bti:
        title: "Democracy score"
        description_short: |-
          Captures the extent of democratic features — political participation, rule of law, stable democratic institutions, political and social integration, and a capable state. It ranges from 1 to 10 (most democratic).
        description_processing: |-
          Values for continents have been obtained by averaging the values of the countries in the continent.

      regime_bti:
        title: "Political regime"
        description_short: |-
          Identifies the political regime of a country. It distinguishes between hard-line autocracies (score 5), moderate autocracies (score 4), highly defective democracies (score 3), defective democracies (score 2), and consolidating democracies (score 1).
        description_key:
          - Consolidating democracies have comprehensive democratic features and minimum democratic characteristics (citizens can choose political leaders in free and fair elections and enjoy freedoms of association, expression and some further civil liberties, political power is separated, and leaders can effectively govern a state that fulfils basic functions).
          - Defective democracies have minimum democratic characteristics, but limited other democratic features.
          - Very defective democracies have minimum democratic characteristics, but very limited other democratic features.
          - Moderate autocracies have no minimum democratic characteristics, but possibly other broadly democratic features.
          - Hard-line autocracies have no minimum democratic characteristics, and few other democratic features.
          - It matches the variable cat_dem_stat in Bertelsmann Transformation Index (2022), with some errors for the year 2021 — classifying some democracies as autocracies and vice versa — corrected.

        description_short: |-
          Indicates the extent to which elections are free from irregularities, the rights to vote, run for office, and campaign are unrestricted, registration is easy, and campaigning and media access are fair.
        description_key:
          - "Score of 1: National elections, if held at all, are entirely unfree and unfair."
          - "Score of 4: General elections are held, but serious irregularities during voting process and ballot count occur. The rights to vote, campaign and run for office are restricted, and elections have de facto only limited influence over who governs."
          - "Score of 7: General, multi-party elections are held, conducted properly and accepted as the means of filling political posts. However, there are some constraints on the fairness of the elections with regard to registration, campaigning or media access."

          - "Score of 10: Democratically elected political representatives have the effective power to govern. No individual or group is holding any de facto veto power."

          - "Score of 10: Freedom of expression is guaranteed against interference or government restrictions. Individuals, groups and the press can fully exercise these rights."

          - "Score of 7: The separation of powers is in place and functioning. Checks and balances are occasionally subject to interference, but a restoration of balance is sought."
          - "Score of 10: There is a clear separation of powers with mutual checks and balances."

          - "Score of 7: Civil rights are codified by law, but are not properly respected and protected. Mechanisms and institutions to prosecute, punish and redress violations of civil rights are in place, but are not consistently effective."
          - "Score of 10: Civil rights are codified by law and respected by all state institutions, which actively prevent discrimination. Residents are effectively protected by mechanisms and institutions established to prosecute, punish and redress violations of their rights."

          - This indicator distinguishes between (electoral) democracies (score 1) and non-democracies (score 0).

        description_processing: *description_processing_main
        description_from_producer: |-
          Indicator generated from `democracy_omitteddata`. This is the same measure as `democracy`, except it records an NA for countries occupied during an international war (e.g., the Netherlands 1940-44) or experiencing state collapse during a civil war (e.g., Lebanon 1976-89). The `democracy` variable instead fills in these years as continuations of the same regime type to avoid coding democratic transitions at the end of military occupations. Researchers who want to code this differently can fill in the NA values in `democracy_omitteddata` with 0.

      total_score:
        title: Total democracy score
        unit: ""
        description_short: |-
          Freedom House's total democracy score is a 0-to-100 aggregate that adds up a country's points on 25 indicators of political rights (max 40) and civil liberties (max 60), creating a single snapshot of the freedoms people actually enjoy.

        description_key:
          - It distills a detailed checklist—10 political-rights and 15 civil-liberties questions—into one intuitive figure, making complex governance data easy to grasp.
          - The number is the gateway to Freedom House's headline categories Free, Partly Free, Not Free, so a small point swing can shift a country's global status.
          - "Scores are re-evaluated each year: analysts adjust points only when real-world events warrant, allowing the metric to flag both rapid crackdowns and gradual reforms."

      civlibs:
        title: Civil liberties rating
        unit: ""
        description_short: |-
          Identifies the extent of freedom of expression and association, the rule of law, and personal autonomy. Lower ratings indicate more liberties.
        description_key:
          - It is measured on a one-to-seven scale, with one representing the highest degree of Freedom and seven the lowest.

      polrights:
        title: Political rights rating
        unit: ""
        description_short: |-
          Identifies the extent of free and fair elections, political pluralism and participation, and a functioning government. Lower ratings indicate more rights.
        description_key:

        unit: ""
        description_short: |-
          The variable identifies the political regime of a country. It distinguishes between free countries (score 2), partly free countries (score 1), and not free countries (score 0).

        description_key:
          - Free countries are understood as countries in which citizens have many political rights (free and fair elections, political pluralism and participation, functioning government) and civil liberties (freedoms of expression and association, rule of law, personal autonomy).
          - Partly free country are countries in which citizens have some political rights and civil liberties.
          - Not free country are countries in which citizens have few political rights and civil liberties.

        description_short: |-
          Identifies the fine-grained extent of free and fair elections, political pluralism and participation, and a functioning government. Higher scores indicate more rights.

      civlibs_score:
        title: Civil liberties score
        unit: ""
        description_short: |-
          The variable identifies the fine-grained extent of freedom of expression and association, the rule of law, and personal autonomy. Higher scores indicate more liberties.

      electdem:
        title: Electoral democracy
        unit: ""
        description_short: |-
          Identifies if the political regime of a country is an electoral democracy. It identifies whether a country is an electoral democracy (score 1) or not (score 0).

        description_processing: |-
          This is a binary indicator which we define as follows:

          * score 1: If `electprocess >= 7`, `polrights_score >= 20` and `civlibs_score >= 30`.
          * score NA: If `electprocess`, `polrights_score` and `civlibs_score` values are all missing.
          * score 0: Otherwise.

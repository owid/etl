      total_score:
        title: Total democracy score
        unit: ""
        description_short: |-
          Freedom House's total democracy score is a 0-to-100 aggregate that adds up a country's points on 25 indicators of political rights (max 40) and civil liberties (max 60), creating a single snapshot of the freedoms people actually enjoy.

        description_key:
          - It distills a detailed checklist—10 political-rights and 15 civil-liberties questions—into one intuitive figure, making complex governance data easy to grasp.
          - The number is the gateway to Freedom House's headline categories Free, Partly Free, Not Free, so a small point swing can shift a country's global status.
          - "Scores are re-evaluated each year: analysts adjust points only when real-world events warrant, allowing the metric to flag both rapid crackdowns and gradual reforms."

      civlibs:
        title: Civil liberties rating
        unit: ""
        description_short: |-

        description_key:
          - It is measured on a one-to-seven scale, with one representing the highest degree of Freedom and seven the lowest.

      polrights:

        unit: ""
        description_short: |-
          Identifies the extent of free and fair elections, political pluralism and participation, and a functioning government. Lower ratings indicate more rights.

        unit: ""
        description_short: |-
          The variable identifies the political regime of a country. It distinguishes between free countries (score 2), partly free countries (score 1), and not free countries (score 0).

        description_key:

          - Not free country are countries in which citizens have few political rights and civil liberties.

        unit: ""
        description_short: |-

      electdem:
        title: Electoral democracy
        unit: ""
        description_short: |-

        description_processing: |-
          This is a binary indicator which we define as follows:

          * score 1: If `electprocess >= 7`, `polrights_score >= 20` and `civlibs_score >= 30`.
          * score NA: If `electprocess`, `polrights_score` and `civlibs_score` values are all missing.
          * score 0: Otherwise.

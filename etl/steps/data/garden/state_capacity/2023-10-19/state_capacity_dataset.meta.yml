        title: Administrative efficiency
        unit: ""
        short_unit: ""
        description_short: "Based on the expert assesments by Adelman and Morris (1967). It captures efficiency of public administration by combining measures of permanence and training of administrators, corruption and inefficiencies, and instability of policy. It ranges from 0 to 8 (most efficient)"
        description_key:
        - "Encompasses three categories of the efficiency of public administration: \"the degree of permanence and training of administrators\", \"the extent to which corruption, ineffciency and incompetence seriously hamper government functioning\" and \"the extent to which instability of policy at higher levels of administration promotes inefficiency\"."
        description_from_producer: >|
          As part of a study on the social and political sources of economic growth in developing countries,
          Adelman and Morris (1967) produced a measure of “degree of administrative efficiency” for 69
          countries. The measure encompasses three categories of the efficiency of public administration:
          “the degree of permanence and training of administrators,” the “extent to which corruption, inefficiency and incompetence seriously hamper government functioning,” and the “extent to which
          instability of policy at higher levels of administration promotes inefficiency”.


          To make these assessments, Adelman and Morris interviewed regional and country experts,
          compiled information from country studies, and checked their findings against those of other analysts. The period of observation was 1957-1962, overlapping our period of analysis for the years
          1960-1962.


          The ratings reflect a letter grade system akin to those of student in school, including minuses
          and plusses:
          -A grade of A signifies that the country has a reasonably efficient public administration with
          “well-trained civil services” and low levels of corruption.
          -A grade of B signifies that the country has “considerable bureaucratic inefficiency but . . .
          a permanent body of administrators” (p. 78). Corruption and policy instability were present
          but did not significantly interfere with government functioning.
          -A grade of C signifies “extreme bureaucratic inefficiency and/or widespread corruption and/or
          serious instability of policy at higher administrative levels”.


          Once accounting for pluses and minuses, this measurement strategy produces a nine-point scale
          (0 to 8).

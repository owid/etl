        description_short: "Based on the expert assessments by Adelman and Morris (1967). It captures efficiency of public administration by combining measures of permanence and training of administrators, corruption and inefficiencies, and instability of policy. It ranges from 0 to 8 (most efficient)"
        description_from_producer: >-
          As part of a study on the social and political sources of economic growth in developing countries,
          Adelman and Morris (1967) produced a measure of “degree of administrative efficiency” for 69
          countries. The measure encompasses three categories of the efficiency of public administration:
          “the degree of permanence and training of administrators,” the “extent to which corruption, inefficiency and incompetence seriously hamper government functioning,” and the “extent to which
          instability of policy at higher levels of administration promotes inefficiency”.


          To make these assessments, Adelman and Morris interviewed regional and country experts,
          compiled information from country studies, and checked their findings against those of other analysts. The period of observation was 1957-1962, overlapping our period of analysis for the years
          1960-1962.


          The ratings reflect a letter grade system akin to those of student in school, including minuses
          and plusses:
          - A grade of A signifies that the country has a reasonably efficient public administration with
          “well-trained civil services” and low levels of corruption.
          - A grade of B signifies that the country has “considerable bureaucratic inefficiency but . . .
          a permanent body of administrators”. Corruption and policy instability were present
          but did not significantly interfere with government functioning.
          - A grade of C signifies “extreme bureaucratic inefficiency and/or widespread corruption and/or
          serious instability of policy at higher administrative levels”.


          Once accounting for pluses and minuses, this measurement strategy produces a nine-point scale
          (0 to 8).

          As part of its International Country Risk Guide (ICRG), the PRS Group rates the “institutional
          strength and quality of the bureaucracy” in a country on a 5-point scale (0 to 4). High values
          represent bureaucracies that have the “strength and expertise to govern without drastic changes in
          policy or interruptions of government services.” Among the criteria for bureaucratic quality are the
          degree of autonomy from political pressure and protocols for recruitment and training of staff. See

        description_from_producer: >-
          Census frequency is inspired by Soifer (2013) and adapted from Hanson (2015). For each year,
          the variable is calculated as 10 divided by the number of years between censuses, with the annual
          values smoothed using a five-year moving average. The measure thus equals 1 if a country has
          a census every ten years and moves toward 0 the greater the number of years between censuses.
          Source data on census dates come from the International Programs Center of the U.S. Census

          This is the `v2clrspct` variable from version 9 of the Varieties of Democracy project (Coppedge et al.
          2019). The measure comes from a Bayesian item response theory measurement model using expert
          survey data in which the respondents rated countries based on the following category descriptions:
          - 0: The law is not respected by public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the law
          is rampant.
          - 1: The law is weakly respected by public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the
          law is widespread.
          - 2: The law is modestly respected by public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of
          the law is moderate.
          - 3: The law is mostly respected by public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the
          law is limited.
          - 4: The law is generally fully respected by the public officials. Arbitrary or biased administration of the law is very limited.

          This is the state fiscal capacity (`v2stfisccap`) variable from version 9 of the Varieties of Democracy
          project (Coppedge et al. 2019). The measure is a Bayesian item response theory measurement
          model based on a five-point ordinal scale (0-4) in which higher values indicate that the state has
          greater capacity to fund itself through taxes that are of greater administrative complexity.
          - 0: The state is not capable of raising revenue to finance itself.
          - 1: The state primarily relies on external sources of funding (loans and foreign aid) to finance
          its activities.
          - 2: The state primarily relies on directly controlling economic assets (natural resource rents,
          public monopolies, and the expropriation of assets within and outside the country) to finance
          its activities.
          - 3: The state primarily relies on taxes on property (land taxes) and trade (customs duties).
          - 4: The state primarily relies on taxes on economic transactions (such as sales taxes) and/or
          taxes on income, corporate profits and capital

        description_short: Based on the expert assessments by V-Dem. It captures the extent to which the state has effective control over its territory.
        description_from_producer: >-
          For this indicator, we start with the `v2svstterr` measure of state authority over territory from V-Dem.
          This is a measure in which country experts are asked to estimate the percentage of the territory
          in a country over which the state has effective control. Given the highly skewed distribution of
          this variable, we convert the percentage to a proportion and then transform it using the inverse
          normal. Where a state has control of 100% of country territory, and the inverse normal is thus
          undefined, we instead use the inverse normal of .9999. The resulting scale is thus similar to that of
          a standard normal distribution, and the effect is to widen the range of scores where the data are very
          concentrated at near 100% territorial control. The data cover 177 countries during the 1960-2015
          time period.

        description_short: Measures the ability of the state to collect and process information. It ranges from 0 to 1 (greater information capacity).
        description_from_producer: >-
          The original measure was estimated using an Item Response Theory (IRT) model using the following indicators:
          - when the country first established a statistical agency
          - whether the country has a civil register
          - whether the country has a population register
          - a measure of the country’s ability to conduct a regular census
          - a measure of the country’s ability to produce an annual statistical yearbook.


          Coverage is 1960-2015 for 66 countries. For a small number of country-years at the end of this
          period, where the IRT estimates were not available, values were constructed using a parallel set
          of estimates from a principal components analysis (PCA) involving the same indicators. First, if
          the estimates from the PCA model did not change from one year to the next, IRT estimates were
          extended forward. Second, all remaining cases use the predicted values from regressing the IRT
          estimates on the PCA estimates.

          In the original, the World Bank’s Statistical Capacity Indicator is a scale that ranges from 0 to 100.
          It is based on a set of 25 criteria that fall into three main categories: methodology, sources of data,
          and periodicity/timeliness of data:
          - Methodology includes: balance of payments manual in use, CPI base year, government finance accounting, external debt reporting, import/export price indices, industrial production
          index, national accounts base year, accuracy of data on national immunization coverage,
          special dissemination standard, and UNESCO reporting.
          - Sources include: agricultural census, health survey, population census, poverty survey, and
          vital registration system coverage.
          - Periodicity/timeliness measures reporting of data on: access to water, child malnutrition,
          child mortality, gender equality, HIV/AIDS, immunizations, income poverty, maternal health,

          We have divided the resulting measure by 100 so that 1 is the highest possible value. The data
          cover 127 countries from 2004 to 2015.

          For this measure, we start with the Government Revenue Dataset from the International Centre
          for Tax and Development (ICTD). We then expand coverage of these data considerably through a
          variety of sources: International Monetary Fund yearbooks, electronic archives of older IMF data,
          and a collection of estimates from scholars studying specific countries. Using these source data, we
          calculate the percentage of total tax revenue that comes from taxes on income, profits, and capital
          gains. For use in analysis, we rescale this percentage to a proportion. The data cover 1963-2015
          for 168 countries, with broad coverage beginning in the early 1970s.

          A graded index of the ability of the country
          to carry out censuses consistently with different degrees of
          difficulty. The index takes the value 30 if the country ran a census
          based on a continuously updated population register (based on
          register_based_census), 20 if it ran a modern (enumeration-based)
          census (censuses implement-ed after first_moderncensus takes the
          value 1 but that were not based on population registers), and 10 if it
          ran a non-modern census. The index is depreciated by 1 point for
          every consecutive year without a census, starting 10 years after the
          previous census. Therefore, the index takes a value of 0 after 20
          years without any census, after 30 years from the last modern
          census, and after 40 years from the last register-based census.

        description_from_producer: >-
          Dummy variable that takes a value 1 if the country has a
          statistical agency operating that year, and 0 otherwise. A statistical
          agency is an official government organization that is tasked with
          gathering numerical information on a variety of topics. We as-sign
          the value 0 to this variable when these tasks were absorbed by
          several government offices that performed other functions besides
          collecting and maintaining numerical in-formation.

        description_from_producer: >-
          Dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the country ran a
          census that year and 0 otherwise. A census is a population count
          that meets three requirements: (1) universality (it seeks to cover the
          entire population); (2) defined territory (it counts the population
          within a well-defined territory); and (3) simultaneity (each person is
          counted within a discrete time window).

          Dummy variable that takes the value 1 the year
          a country first implemented a modern census (it is missing
          otherwise). A modern census meets all three requirements from the
          census variable plus a fourth one â€“ (4) individual enumeration,
          which means that the census produces tabular data sets with
          disaggregated information for each individual.

          country runs a census that is based on a continuously updated
          population register (as opposed to an enumeration carried out
          during a discrete period of time) and 0 otherwise.

          A statistical yearbook is an annual publication of the state that
          contains numerical data about the country regarding several of the
          following categories: physical environment, demography, economic
          affairs, political affairs, and social and cultural affairs.

          following year) and 0 otherwise.

          Dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the country
          maintained a birth register that year and 0 otherwise. A civil register
          is a government agency that records key events in the life
          trajectories of individuals (such as births, marriages, and deaths).
          We include parish registers when they were administered by official
          state churches (as in the Nordic countries) but not when the Church
          was not part of the state (as in the Catholic world).

          Population registers are centralized state agencies that keep detailed
          and permanently updated records of every person in the territory.

          first adoption of a statistical agency, even if it was later abolished
          (which only occurred in France, Germany and Denmark) and 0 for
          all previous years.

        description_from_producer: >-
          A graded index of the ability of the country
          to carry out census-es consistently with different degrees of
          difficulty. The index takes the value 30 if the country ran a census
          based on a continuously updated population register (based on
          register_based_census), 20 if it ran a modern (enumeration-based)
          census (censuses implement-ed after first_moderncensus takes the
          value 1 but that were not based on population registers), and 10 if it
          ran a non-modern census. The index is depreciated by 1 point for
          every consecutive year without a census, starting 10 years after the
          previous census. Therefore, the index takes a value of 0 after 20
          years without any census, after 30 years from the last modern
          census, and after 40 years from the last register-based census.

          A graded index of the ability of the country to
          publish a statistical yearbook over a ten-year window. The index
          takes the value 10 when the country published a statistical yearbook
          covering that year (based on yearbook_coverage) and is depreciated
          by 1 point for each consecutive year without a statistical yearbook.
          Therefore, the index takes the value 0 after 10 years without
          statistical yearbooks published.

          An aggregate index of information capacity. It is based
          on a hybrid two-parameter and graded Item Response Model (IRT)
          that is based on five component indicators â€“ when the country first
          established a statistical agency (statag_intro), whether the country
          had in place a civil register (civreg) and a population register
          (popreg), and the graded indexes of census ability
          (censusgraded_ability) and yearbook ability (ybcov_ability).

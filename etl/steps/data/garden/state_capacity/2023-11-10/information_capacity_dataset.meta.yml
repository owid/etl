          agency is an official government organization that is tasked with
          gathering numerical information on a variety of topics. We assign
          the value 0 to this variable when these tasks were absorbed by
          several government offices that performed other functions besides
          collecting and maintaining numerical in-formation.

          that meets three requirements: (1) universality (it seeks to cover the
          entire population); (2) defined territory (it counts the population
          within a well-defined territory); and (3) simultaneity (each person is

          a country first implemented a modern census (it is missing
          otherwise). A modern census meets all three requirements from the
          census variable plus a fourth one – (4) individual enumeration,
          which means that the census produces tabular data sets with
          disaggregated information for each individual.

          Dummy variable that takes the value 1 if the
          country runs a census that is based on a continuously updated
          population register (as opposed to an enumeration carried out

          A statistical yearbook is an annual publication of the state that

          is a government agency that records key events in the life
          trajectories of individuals (such as births, marriages, and deaths).
          We include parish registers when they were administered by official

        description_from_producer: >-
          A graded index of the ability of the country
          to carry out censuses consistently with different degrees of
          difficulty. The index takes the value 30 if the country ran a census
          based on a continuously updated population register (based on
          register_based_census), 20 if it ran a modern (enumeration-based)
          census (censuses implement-ed after first_moderncensus takes the
          value 1 but that were not based on population registers), and 10 if it
          ran a non-modern census. The index is depreciated by 1 point for
          every consecutive year without a census, starting 10 years after the
          previous census. Therefore, the index takes a value of 0 after 20
          years without any census, after 30 years from the last modern
          census, and after 40 years from the last register-based census.

        description_from_producer: >-
          A graded index of the ability of the country to
          publish a statistical yearbook over a ten-year window. The index
          takes the value 10 when the country published a statistical yearbook
          covering that year (based on yearbook_coverage) and is depreciated
          by 1 point for each consecutive year without a statistical yearbook.
          Therefore, the index takes the value 0 after 10 years without
          statistical yearbooks published.

          - The data has been shifted one year earlier to align harvest-year data with satellite observations. Although not explicitly mentioned in the paper, this seems to be the approach followed to produce the series of Fig. 1.

          - The series was rescaled so that its lowest and highest values match those of the FAO yield data for each country, enabling direct comparison of trends.

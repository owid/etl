    This dataset combines data for European countries from two key sources:
    - Data from prior to 1961 is sourced from Table 1.2 of Understanding Green Revolutions, by Bayliss-Smith & Wanmali (1984).
    - Wheat yields from 1961 onwards are as reported by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations.

    All values of yield have been converted to tonnes per hectare.

          Harvested production per unit of harvested area for wheat.
        description_key:
          - In most of the cases yield data are not recorded but obtained by dividing the production data by the data on area harvested.
          - Data on yields of permanent crops are not as reliable as those for temporary crops.

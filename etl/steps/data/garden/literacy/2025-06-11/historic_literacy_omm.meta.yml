      - Where only one of literacy or illiteracy was reported, the other was derived by subtracting the given value from 100%.
      - For 1950, data was reported as a range (e.g. 10–20%). To allow for consistent analysis, these ranges were converted into single-point estimates by taking their midpoint. For example, a range of 10–20% was recorded as 15%.

dataset:
  title: Historic literacy rates - Combined sources
  description: >
    This dataset combines historical and contemporary literacy rates from various sources to provide a long-term view of global literacy trends from 1451 to the present.
    It includes estimates based on book sales, UNESCO reports, and SDG indicators, covering different age groups and methodologies.

          - Literacy is essential for full participation in education, employment, and civic life. This indicator measures the share of people aged 15 and older who can read and write a short, simple sentence with understanding.
          - The data is compiled from multiple historical and contemporary sources. Because definitions and methods vary across time and countries, figures are not always directly comparable.
          - "1451–1800: European countries — Data for Great Britain, Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Poland are based on the 'Charting the Rise of the West' study. Literacy rates are estimated using manuscript and early printed book production as proxies, due to the lack of direct census data."
          - "1820–1870s: Global estimates — From the OECD’s 'How Was Life? Global Well-being Since 1820' report. Early estimates reflect broad definitions of being 'educated'. Over time, the focus narrowed to basic reading and writing skills, influenced by the spread of mass education."
          - "1900–1950: 26 countries — Based on UNESCO’s first comparative survey of illiteracy. Data is drawn from national censuses and official sources. Definitions varied widely: some countries counted those who could read or write, others required both, and in some cases, being able to sign one’s name was sufficient. Age thresholds ranged from 5 to 15 years."
          - "1950: Global coverage — UNESCO’s 'World Illiteracy at Mid-Century' report provided the first global overview of adult literacy, covering over 60 countries. Most data came from censuses conducted between 1945 and 1954 for the 15+ population. Where data was missing, estimates were made using past trends and country-specific information. Results are reported in 5% intervals to reflect uncertainty."
          - "1970–Present: UNESCO Institute for Statistics — Contemporary data comes from censuses and household surveys conducted by national governments. Literacy is defined as the ability to read and write a short, simple statement about daily life, and often includes basic numeracy. The rate is calculated as the number of literate individuals aged 15 and over, divided by the total population in that age group."
          - Across all periods, the indicator reflects basic literacy — the ability to read and write simple text. It does not measure functional literacy, which refers to the ability to apply these skills effectively in everyday situations, such as reading instructions, completing forms, or managing finances. Functional literacy is typically acquired after several years of formal education.

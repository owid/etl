      - This dataset combines literacy and illiteracy rates from multiple historical and contemporary sources to provide the most comprehensive long-term view of global literacy development from 1451 to present.
      - "**Historical data (1451-1800):** Estimates from Buringh and van Zanden (2009) based on book sales data. This method uses the relationship between book prices and sales volumes to estimate literate populations, assuming people primarily buy books they can read."
      - "**Early 20th century data (1900-1950):** UNESCO historical estimates from their 1953 report 'Progress of Literacy in Various Countries'. This covers the period when governments began systematic literacy measurement but methodologies varied significantly between countries."
      - "**Mid-century data (1950):** UNESCO estimates from their 1957 report 'World Illiteracy at Mid-Century', providing comprehensive global coverage for this benchmark year."
      - "**Recent historical data (1820-1970):** OECD's 'How Was Life?' dataset combined with World Bank indicators, covering the period when more standardized measurement approaches emerged."
      - "**Contemporary data (1970-present):** UNESCO Sustainable Development Goals education indicators, representing the current international standard for literacy measurement focused on population aged 15+."
      - "**Important methodological notes:** Age groups vary across time periods and sources. Early historical data often measured literacy from age 10+, while modern standards focus on ages 15+. Users should consider these methodological differences when making comparisons across time periods."
      - Where illiteracy rates were not directly available, they were calculated as 100 minus the literacy rate, and vice versa.

    title: Historic literacy rates - Combined sources
    description: >
      This table combines literacy and illiteracy data from five major sources:
      Buringh & van Zanden historical estimates (1451-1800), UNESCO historical reports (1900-1950),
      OECD How Was Life dataset (1820-1970), and UNESCO SDG indicators (2000-present).

          Combined from multiple sources with different methodologies and age groups.
          Historical data (1451-1800) estimated from book sales; early 20th century data from
          UNESCO reports; mid-century from UNESCO global surveys; recent data from UNESCO SDG indicators.
          Where not directly available, calculated as 100 minus illiteracy rate.

        description_processing: >
          Combined from multiple sources with different methodologies and age groups.
          Where not directly available, calculated as 100 minus literacy rate.
          Historical sources often measured different age groups (10+ vs 15+), so comparisons
          across time should consider these methodological differences.

      - Where only one of literacy or illiteracy was reported, the other was derived by subtracting the given value from 100%.
      - For 1950, data was reported as a range (e.g. 10–20%). To allow for consistent analysis, these ranges were converted into single-point estimates by taking their midpoint. For example, a range of 10–20% was recorded as 15%.

  title: Historic literacy rates - Combined sources
  description: >
    This dataset combines historical and contemporary literacy rates from various sources to provide a long-term view of global literacy trends from 1451 to the present.
    It includes estimates based on book sales, UNESCO reports, and SDG indicators, covering different age groups and methodologies.

          - Literacy is essential for full participation in education, employment, and civic life. This indicator measures the share of people aged 15 and older who can read and write a short, simple sentence with understanding—though historical sources did not always define or measure literacy consistently.
          - The data is compiled from multiple historical and contemporary sources. Because definitions and methodologies vary significantly across time periods and countries, comparisons should be interpreted with considerable caution.
          - "1451–1800: Data for Great Britain, Ireland, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Poland is based on the [Charting the Rise of the West](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46544350_Charting_the_Rise_of_the_West_Manuscripts_and_Printed_Books_in_Europe_A_Long-Term_Perspective_from_the_Sixth_through_Eighteenth_Centuries) study. Literacy rates are estimated using manuscript and early printed book production as proxies, given the absence of direct census data from this period."
          - "1820–2010: Global estimates are based on the OECD's [How Was Life? Global Well-being Since 1820](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/how-was-life_9789264214262-en.html) report. Pre-late 19th century estimates are limited and often rely on indirect measures, such as the ability to sign marriage certificates, which do not fully capture the modern definition of literacy."
          - "1900–1950: Data for 26 countries comes from UNESCO's [Progress of literacy in various countries](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000002898). Estimates are drawn from national censuses and official sources, though definitions varied widely: some countries counted those who could read or write, others required both skills, and some accepted the ability to sign one's name as sufficient. Age thresholds ranged from 5 to 15 years."
          - "1950: Data for nearly every country comes from UNESCO's [World Illiteracy at Mid-Century](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000002930) report, the first comprehensive global overview of adult literacy. Most figures are based on censuses conducted between 1945 and 1954 for populations aged 15 and older. Where census data was unavailable, estimates were produced using historical trends and country-specific analysis. The source reported literacy in 5% intervals to reflect uncertainty; midpoint values are used in this dataset."
          - "1970–Present: Contemporary data comes from the [UNESCO Institute for Statistics](https://databrowser.uis.unesco.org/resources/bulk) based on censuses and household surveys conducted by national governments. Literacy is defined as the ability to read and write a short, simple statement about daily life, often including basic numeracy. The rate represents literate individuals aged 15 and over as a percentage of the total population in that age group."
          - For many countries, literacy estimates are no longer reported as their importance declined when literacy rates approached 100% by the end of the 20th century.
          - Across all periods, this indicator reflects basic literacy—the ability to read and write simple text. It does not measure functional literacy, which refers to applying these skills effectively in everyday situations, such as reading instructions, completing forms, or managing finances. Functional literacy typically requires several years of formal education beyond basic literacy acquisition.

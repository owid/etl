    We obtained the series for each indicator by extracting the closest observations to <<reference_years>>, respectively. The maximum distance between the year available and the year of reference is 5 years.

    We have also included some exclusions for the years we could extract. We excluded the years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 to avoid capturing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. We also excluded years before 1990 to avoid capturing data for countries in socialist regimes.

    Additionally, for the World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform dataset, we rank multiple matchings following this order of preference:
      1. The same welfare concept (first income, then consumption).
      2. The same reporting level (first national, then urban, then rural, then different).

  description_processing_reduced_set: |-
    Finally, this dataset includes only the countries that are available in both the World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform and the World Inequality Database. We applied this restriction so we can compare the results across these two sources more effectively.

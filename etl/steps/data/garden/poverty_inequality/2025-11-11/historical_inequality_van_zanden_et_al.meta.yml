              i. Central statistical agencies
              ii. Historical reconstructions
              iii. Estimates
              iv. Conjectures
          Virtually all benchmark data after 1960 are derived indirectly from Central Statistical Agencies and therefore probably better classify as historical reconstructions. The remaining data are estimates and, further back in time, conjectures.

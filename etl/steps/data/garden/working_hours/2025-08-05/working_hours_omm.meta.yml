          - This indicator combines data from Huberman and Minns (2007) (between 1870 and 1938) with the Penn World Table (1950 onward).
          - "The definitions of working hours differ between the sources: while Huberman and Minns focus on full-time production workers in non-agricultural activities, Penn World Table data includes all employees and self-employed people in the economy."
          - Even considering these differences, the data from Huberman and Minns represent a good approximation of the average working hours in the past.

      affordability:
        title: Housing affordability
        description_short: Housing affordability in the long run, given as the ratio of real rents to real wages and normalized to 1900=100.
        unit: Index
        short_unit: ""
      real_wage:
        title: Real wages
        description_short: Real wages, normalized to 1900=100 and adjusted for inflation.
        description_key:
          - This data comes from the paper "The Housing Affordability Revolution" by Korevaar et al. (2023). It provides insights into the long-term trends in housing affordability across various countries, focusing on the ratio of real rents to real wages.
          - Real wages are based on multiple sources, such as day wages and annual wages of various industries, collective labour agreements, tax documentation and existing wage indices.
          - The researchers adjusted the raw values for inflation by constructing a long-term consumer price index for each country.
        unit: Index
        short_unit: ""
      real_rent:
        title: Real rents
        description_short: Real rents, normalized to 1900=100. These values are adjusted for inflation and improvements in quality of the housing stock. Quality improvements take into account amenities such as the availability of indoor bathrooms and toilets, kitchens, electricity, and central heating.

          - Real rents are based on multiple sources, such as historical records of rents from institutional accounts, rent control records, tax documentation and existing rent indices.
          - The researchers adjusted the raw values for inflation by constructing a long-term consumer price index for each country. They also adjusted for improvements in the quality of the housing stock, which includes amenities such as the availability of indoor bathrooms and toilets, kitchens, electricity, and central heating.
          - In Paris, strict rent controls kept real rents extremely low until 1948, boosting affordability but making it hard to find housing. A major reform that year ended the system, leading to a return to more typical rent levels.

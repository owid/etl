    title: Historical housing affordability indices
    description: |-
      The paper documents the long-run evolution of urban housing affordability in seven major European cities from 1500 to 2024. Using nearly half a million rent observations, we construct annual indices of rents and wages and develop new estimates of housing quality, inequality, and expenditure shares. Over this period, real rents increased slowly-by just 0.17 percent annually on average-while housing quality improved substantially even before industrialization. From the 1910s to the 1970s, we document a "housing affordability revolution": real wages grew markedly faster than rents, housing quality rose sharply, and housing consumption inequality declined-coinciding with large-scale housing policy. Yet housing expenditure shares are higher today than a century ago, not because affordability declined, but because housing consumption increased and household size declined - challenging models with constant expenditure shares. Our findings establish new stylized facts on housing rents, quality, and inequality over five centuries, and highlight the long-run role of preferences, institutions, and policy in shaping affordability.

    title: Historical housing quality indicators
    description: |-
      How do housing rents, quality and affordability evolve when cities grow over time? This paper studies urban housing markets for half a millennium (1500-2017) for Amsterdam, Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, Ghent, London, and Paris. Based on a dataset of 436,000 rent observations, we build new indices of housing rents, quality and inequality, and relate these to changes in wages and population. Long-term growth in real rent prices has been limited. Before 1900, markets were unregulated and rent prices and wages rose in tandem when cities grew, while housing quality and inequality increased. After 1900, housing affordability started improving substantially, and we show that short-term improvements in this period were partially attributable to rent controls. Most of the surge in housing expenditure that did occur over time is due to increasing housing quality rather than rising rent.

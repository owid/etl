      - The MIrreM data base often includes multiple estimates for the same country and year. In these cases, we chose the estimate with the highest "Aggregate Score" (a measure of the transparency and data availability of the estimate) as the estimate we use.
      - If only a range of estimates was available, the central estimate refers to the midpoint of that range. The lower and upper estimates are the lower and upper bounds of the range, respectively.
      - Some estimates where only given as an upper bound (e.g. <100,000). In that case we used the upper bound (e.g. 100,000) as the higher bound of the estimate and 0 as the lower bound. In this example this leads to a midpoint estimate of 50,000.

      - These estimates are collected from a variety of sources, including government statistics, academic studies or other publications. They differ in terms of methodology, data sources, and definitions of "irregular migration".
      - Since different countries use different definitions of "irregular migration", the estimates in this data set are not directly comparable across countries.

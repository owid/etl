      Data denotes the range of CO2 mitigation curves for a range of 'start year scenarios': Scenarios are based on the annual emission reductions necessary to keep global temperature rise below 1.5°C if emissions mitigation was to start in a given year.

      For example, 'Start in 2010' marks the necessary future emissions pathway to have a >66% chance of keeping global average temperatures below 1.5°C warming if global CO2 emissions mitigation had started in 2010, very quickly peaking then falling.

      Data is sourced from Robbie Andrew, and available for download [here](http://folk.uio.no/roberan/t/global_mitigation_curves.shtml).

      Historical emissions to 2017 are sourced from CDIAC/Global Carbon Project, projection to 2018 from Global Carbon Project (Le Quéré et al. 2018).

      Global cumulative CO2 emissions budgets are from the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C (Rogelj et al 2018): 420 GtCO2 for a 66% of 1.5°C and 1170 GtCO2 for a 66% of 2°C. Mitigation curves describe approximately exponential decay pathways such that the quota is never exceeded (see Raupach et al., 2014).

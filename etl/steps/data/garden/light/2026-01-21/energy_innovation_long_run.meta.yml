  description_key_price_of_lighting: |-
    To calculate the price of lighting – today or historically – three different prices need to be known: (1) the prices of the relevant energy source, (2) the equipment to provide this light (e.g. a kerosene lamp), (3) how efficiently the available technology at the time can turn the energy into light. The latter is referred to as the _lighting technology efficiency_ in the literature and is measured in units of energy used for each lumen-hour of light generated.

  description_key_price_of_lighting_weights: |-
    Prices are weighted from the combination of lighting sources at any given period of time. For example, prices of lighting from candles, whale oil, and gas will differ. The average price is, therefore, weighted by the share of each source in total lighting consumption.

  description_key_inflation: |-
    This data is adjusted for inflation, using long-run consumer price indices from the Bank of England's A Millennium of Macroeconomic Data dataset.

  description_key_price_of_lighting_rolling_avg: |-
    We calculated a 5-year rolling average to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends in the price of lighting.

  description_key_weeks_of_earnings_needed_for_reading: |-
    We converted historical lighting prices (given as cost per 1 million lumen-hours) into the daily cost of reading light by scaling to 800 lumen-hours. We then expressed this daily cost relative to incomes by dividing it by real average weekly earnings from A Millennium of Macroeconomic Data, matched to the same price terms as the lighting series.

  description_key_days_of_earnings_needed_for_reading: |-
    Additionally, we converted the resulting value from weeks to days by multiplying the series by 5, assuming a five-day workweek.

  description_short_price_of_lighting: |-
    The price for lighting per million lumen-hours. 1 lumen-hour is equal to the luminous energy emitted in 1 hour by a light source emitting a luminous flux of 1 lumen. For comparison: a standard 100W incandescent light bulb emits around 1600 lumen.

  description_processing_weeks_of_earnings_needed_for_reading: |-
    To construct this indicator, we converted the lighting price series from Fouquet and Pearson (2006) and Fouquet (2026) (originally expressed as the cost per 1 million lumen-hours) into the daily cost of lighting suitable for reading, assuming 800 lumen-hours. This was done by dividing the original series by 1,000,000 and multiplying by 800.

    We then divided this daily lighting cost by a series of real average weekly earnings. The earnings data come from the A Millennium of Macroeconomic Data dataset, and is expressed in the same price terms as the lighting data.

  description_short_days_of_earnings_needed_for_reading: |-
    Additionally, we converted weeks to days by multiplying the series by 5, assuming a 5-day workweek.

  description_short_price_of_lighting: |-
    The price for lighting per million lumen-hours. 1 lumen-hour is equal to the luminous energy emitted in 1 hour by a light source emitting a luminous flux of 1 lumen. For comparison: a standard 100W incandescent light bulb emits around 1600 lumen. This data is expressed in British pounds, adjusted for inflation.

  description_processing_weeks_of_earnings_needed_for_reading: |-
    To construct this indicator, we converted the lighting price series (originally expressed as the cost per 1 million lumen-hours) into the daily cost of lighting suitable for reading, assuming 800 lumen-hours per day. This was done by dividing the original series by 1,000,000 and multiplying by 800.

    We then divided this daily lighting cost by a series of real average weekly earnings. The earnings data come from the A Millennium of Macroeconomic Data dataset, extended with average weekly earnings from the UK Office for National Statistics, and are expressed in the same price terms as the lighting data.

  description_short_days_of_earnings_needed_for_reading: |-
    Additionally, we converted weeks to days by multiplying the series by 5, assuming a 5-day workweek.

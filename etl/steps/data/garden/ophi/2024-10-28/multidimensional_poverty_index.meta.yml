    # Description from producer
    description_from_producer: >-
      The global MPI is a measure of acute poverty covering over 100 countries in the developing
      regions of the world. This measure is based on the dual-cutoff counting approach to poverty
      developed by Alkire and Foster (2011). The global MPI was developed in 2010 by Alkire and
      Santos (2014, 2010) in collaboration with the UNDP’s Human Development Report Office
      (HDRO). Since its inception, the global MPI has used information from 10 indicators, which are
      grouped into three equally weighted dimensions: health, education, and living standards.
      These dimensions are the same as those used in the UNDP’s Human Development Index.


      In 2018, the first major revision of the global MPI was undertaken, considering improvements in
      survey microdata and better align to the 2030 development agenda insofar as possible (Alkire and
      Jahan, 2018; OPHI, 2018). The revision consisted of adjustments in the definition of five out of
      the ten indicators, namely child mortality, nutrition, years of schooling, housing and assets. Alkire,
      Kanagaratnam, Nogales and Suppa (2022) provide a comprehensive analysis of the consequences
      of the 2018 revision. The normative and empirical decisions that underlie the revision of the global
      MPI, and adjustments related to the child mortality, nutrition, years of schooling and housing
      indicators are discussed in Alkire and Kanagaratnam (2021). The revision of assets indicator is
      detailed in Vollmer and Alkire (2022).


      The global MPI begins by establishing a deprivation profile for each person, showing which of the
      10 indicators they are deprived in. Each person is identified as deprived or non-deprived in each
      indicator based on a deprivation cutoff. In the case of health and education, each
      household member may be identified as deprived or not deprived according to available
      information for other household members. For example, if any household member for whom data
      exist is undernourished, each person in that household is considered deprived in nutrition. Taking
      this approach – which was required by the data – does not reveal intrahousehold disparities, but
      is intuitive and assumes shared positive (or negative) effects of achieving (or not achieving) certain
      outcomes. Next, looking across indicators, each person’s deprivation score is constructed by
      adding up the weights of the indicators in which they are deprived. The indicators use a nested
      weight structure: equal weights across dimensions and an equal weight for each indicator within a
      dimension. The normalised indicator weight structure of the global MPI means that the living
      standard indicators receive lower weight than health and education related indicators because from
      a policy perspective, each of the three dimensions is of roughly equal normative importance.


      In the global MPI, a person is identified as multidimensionally poor or MPI poor if they are
      deprived in at least one-third of the weighted MPI indicators. In other words, a person is MPI
      poor if the person’s deprivation score is equal to or higher than the poverty cutoff of 33.33 percent.
      After the poverty identification step, we aggregate across individuals to obtain the incidence of
      poverty or headcount ratio (H) which represents the percentage of poor people in the population.
      We then compute the intensity of poverty (A), representing the average percentage of weighted
      deprivations experienced by the poor. We then compute the adjusted poverty headcount ratio (M0)
      or MPI by combining H and A in a multiplicative form (MPI = H x A).


      Both the incidence and the intensity of these deprivations are highly relevant pieces of information
      for poverty measurement. The incidence of poverty is intuitive and understandable by anyone.
      People always want to know how many poor people there are in a society as a proportion of the
      whole population. Media tend to pick up on the incidence of poverty easily. Yet, the proportion
      of poor people as the headline figure is not enough (Alkire, Oldiges and Kanagaratnam, 2021).


      A headcount ratio is also estimated using two other poverty cutoffs. The global MPI identifies
      individuals as vulnerable to poverty if they are close to the one-third threshold, that is, if they are
      deprived in 20 to 33.32 percent of weighted indicators. The tables also apply a higher poverty
      cutoff to identify those in severe poverty, meaning those deprived in 50 percent or more of the
      dimensions.


      The AF methodology has a property that makes the global MPI even more useful—dimensional
      breakdown. This property makes it possible to consistently compute the percentage of the
      population who are multidimensionally poor and simultaneously deprived in each indicator. This
      is known as the censored headcount ratio of an indicator. The weighted sum of censored
      headcount ratios of all MPI indicators is equal to the MPI value.


      The censored headcount ratio shows the extent of deprivations among the poor but does not
      reflect the weights or relative values of the indicators. Two indicators may have the same censored
      headcount ratios but different contributions to overall poverty, because the contribution depends
      both on the censored headcount ratio and on the weight assigned to each indicator. As such, a
      complementary analysis to the censored headcount ratio is the percentage contribution of each
      indicator to overall multidimensional poverty.

  # For description_short
  description_short_multidimensional_poverty: Multidimensional poverty is defined as being deprived in a range of health, education and living standards indicators.
  description_short_mpi: The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is a measure that combines the prevalence and the intensity of multidimensional poverty on a scale from 0 to 1. Higher values indicate higher poverty.

  description_short_intensity: The intensity is the share of indicators in which people in multidimensional poverty are deprived on average.
  description_short_vulnerable: This is the share of the population that is close to being in multidimensional poverty.
  description_short_severe: This is the share of the population that is in severe multidimensional poverty.
  description_short_censored_headcount_ratio: This is the share of the multidimensionally poor population deprived in the indicator _<<indicator.lower()>>_.
  description_short_uncensored_headcount_ratio: This is the share of the population deprived in the indicator _<<indicator.lower()>>_.

  # For description_key
  description_key_multidimensional_poverty_complement: |-
    grouped into three dimensions of well-being: **health** (using two indicators: nutrition, child mortality), **education** (using two indicators: years of schooling, school attendance), and **living standards** (using six indicators: cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, assets).
  description_key_multidimensional_poverty: |-
    Being in multidimensional poverty means that a person lives in a household deprived in a third or more of ten indicators, {definitions.description_key_multidimensional_poverty_complement}
  description_key_vulnerable: |-
    Being _vulnerable_ to multidimensional poverty means that a person lives in a household deprived in 20-33.3% of ten indicators, {definitions.description_key_multidimensional_poverty_complement}
  description_key_severe: |-
    Being in _severe_ multidimensional poverty means that a person lives in a household deprived in 50% or more of ten indicators, {definitions.description_key_multidimensional_poverty_complement}
  description_key_assessments: |-
    Each household is assessed against specific thresholds for these indicators. For example, a household is considered deprived in the _electricity_ indicator if it does not have access to it. [This article](https://ourworldindata.org/multidimensional-poverty-index) discusses specific thresholds in more detail.
  description_key_weights: |-
    Each indicator contributes to one of the three dimensions of well-being.  Health and education indicators are weighted more (1/6 each) than living standards indicators (1/18 each) so that all three dimensions contribute equally to the overall measure.
  description_key_mpi: |-
    The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is calculated by multiplying two values: the [share of people who are multidimensionally poor](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-multi-poverty) and the [intensity of their poverty](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/intensity-of-multidimensional-poverty-national).

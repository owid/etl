    IHME produced estimates and forecasts for 13 of the SDG indicators included in the Goalkeepers Report.

    IHME provides estimated data for the years 1990-2021 and projections for three different scenarios for the years 2021-2023.

    The scenarios provided are: a reference case, best case and worst case.

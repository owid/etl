  description: |-
    The Luxembourg Income Study Database (LIS) is the largest available income database of harmonized microdata collected from about 50 countries in Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa, Asia, and Australasia spanning five decades.

    Harmonized into a common framework, LIS datasets contain household- and person-level data on labor income, capital income, pensions, public social benefits (excl. pensions) and private transfers, as well as taxes and contributions, demography, employment, and expenditures.

    This dataset contains poverty, inequality and distributional statistics for four different types of income or consumption:

    <ul>
      <li><b>Disposable household income</b>, which is total income minus taxes and social security contributions (available as `dhi` in the LIS dataset).</li>
      <li><b>Disposable household cash income</b>, which is disposable household income minus the total value of goods and services (fringe benefits, home production, in-kind benefits and transfers) (available as `dhci` in the LIS dataset).</li>
      <li><b>Market income</b>, the sum of factor income (labor plus capital income), private income (private cash transfers and in-kind goods and services, not involving goverment) and private pensions (constructed in LIS as `hifactor + hiprivate + hi33`).</li>
      <li><b>Total consumption</b>, including that stemming from goods and services that have been purchased by the household, and goods ans services that have not been purchased, but either given to the household from somebody else, or self-produced (available as `hcexp` in the LIS dataset).</li>
    </ul>

    For each of these types of income or consumption, equivalized and per capita measures are available. 'Equivalized' means that household income or consumption is divided by the LIS equivalence scale (squared root of the number of household members) to address for economies of scale in the household. 'Per capita' means that income or consumption is divided by the total number of household members.

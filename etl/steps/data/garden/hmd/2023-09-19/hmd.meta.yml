      central_death_rate:
        title: Central death rate
        description_short: |-
          For a given population or cohort, the central death rate at age x during a given period of 12 months is found by dividing the number of people who died during this period while aged x by the average number who were living in that age group during the period.
        unit: deaths per capita
      probability_of_death:
        title: Probability of death
        unit: ""
        description_short: The probability that a person who survived until the start of a given interval will have died by the end of the interval.
      average_survival_length:
        title: Average survival length
        short_unit: years
        unit: years
        description_short: Average length of survival between ages x and x+n for persons dying in the interval.
      number_survivors:
        title: Number of survivors
        unit: survivors
        description_short: Number of survivors at exact age x, assuming survivors at 0 years old is 100,000.
      number_deaths:
        title: Number of deaths
        short_unit: deaths
        unit: deaths
        description_short: Number of deaths between ages x and x+n.
      number_person_years_lived:
        title: Number of person-years lived
        unit: person-years
        description_short: Number of person-years lived between ages x and x+n.
      number_person_years_remaining:
        title: Number of person-years remaining
        unit: person-years
        description_short: Number of person-years remaining after exact age x.
      life_expectancy:
        title: Life expectancy
        short_unit: years
        unit: years
        # description_short: |-
        #   The number of years that a person of a given age is expected to live. 'Life expectancy at age 0' refers to life expectancy at birth. For other ages, it refers to the remaining life expectancy for people who have already survived to the given age.
        description: |-
            <% if type == "period" %>
            The average number of years a person is expected to live, based on mortality rates seen across all age groups in a given interval.

            <% elif type == "cohort" %>
            The average number of years that individuals born in a given interval actually lived, based on tracking that birth cohort over time.
            <% endif %>

            'Life expectancy at age 0' refers to life expectancy at birth. For other ages, it refers to the remaining life expectancy for people who have already survived to the given age.
      life_expectancy_fm_diff:
        title: Life expectancy difference (f-m)
        short_unit: years
        unit: years
        description_short: Life expectancy difference (females - males) at exact age x (in years).
      life_expectancy_fm_ratio:
        title: Life expectancy ratio (f/m)
        short_unit: years
        unit: years
        description_short: Life expectancy ratio (females/males) at exact age x (in years).
      exposure:
        title: Exposure-to-risk
        unit: person-years
        description_short: The total number of person-years lived within a given interval.
        description_from_producer: |-
          Estimates of the population exposed to the risk of death during some agetime interval are based on annual (January 1st) population estimates, with small corrections that reflect the timing of deaths during the interval. Period exposure estimations are based on assumptions of uniformity in the distribution of events except when historical monthly birth data are available.

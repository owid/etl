        description_from_producer: |-
          Estimates of the population exposed to the risk of death during some agetime interval are based on annual (January 1st) population estimates, with small corrections that reflect the timing of deaths during the interval. Period exposure estimations are based on assumptions of uniformity in the distribution of events except when historical monthly birth data are available.

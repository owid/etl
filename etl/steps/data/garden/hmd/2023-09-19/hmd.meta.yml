      This is based on a synthetic cohort created using mortality rates across age groups in a given year.

      Rather than waiting for the entire cohort to have died before calculating the cohort life expectancy, researchers may use data from birth cohorts that are 'almost extinct'.

  description: |-
    The Human Mortality Database (HMD) is a collaborative project sponsored by the University of California, Berkeley (in the United States of America) and the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (in Germany).

    It provides researchers with comprehensive data on mortality from around 40 countries around the world, which have very high coverage and quality of data at the national level, through vital registration and potentially census data.

    Data is given in terms of period or cohort estimates:

      - **Period data** refers to a snapshot estimated with data at a particular interval. For period life expectancy at birth, this refers to the estimated life expectancy at birth based on a synthetic cohort created using mortality rates across age groups in a given year.
      - **Cohort data** refers to estimates of a particular birth cohort. For cohort life expectancy at birth, this refers to the average number of years that people in the birth cohort survived. Cohort data may use birth cohorts that are ‘almost extinct’ rather than entirely extinct.

    'Interval' refers to the specific age- and time- period of the estimate. An interval can be a one year period for a single-age group, or it can be wider. For example, the life expectancy of a 40 year old in 2019 corresponds to an interval of 1 single-age group in 1 year. The central death rate of 5–9 year olds in 2020 corresponds to an interval of a 5 year age group in 1 year.

      central_death_rate:
        title: Central death rate
        description_short: |-
          For a given population or cohort, the central death rate during a given 12 month interval is calculated as the number of deaths during the interval, divided by the number of person-years lived during that interval.
        description_key:
          - |-
            Person-years refers to the combined total time that a group of people has lived. For example, if 10 people each live for 2 years, they collectively contribute 20 person-years. This makes the value very slightly different from the 'probability of death' during the interval, because the 'probability of death' metric uses a different denominator: the number of people alive at that age at the start of the interval.
        unit: deaths per 1,000 people
        processing_level: minor
        description_processing: |-
          The original metric is given as a fraction between 0 and 1 (i.e. per-capita). We multiply this by 1,000 to get a per-1,000 people rate.
      probability_of_death:
        title: Probability of death
        unit: "%"
        description_short: |-
          The probability of dying in a given interval, among people who survived to the start of that interval.
        description_key:
          - |-
            For example, the probability of death for a 50 year old in a given year is found by: dividing the number of deaths in 50 year olds that year, by the number of people alive at the age of 50 at the start of the year.
        processing_level: minor
        description_processing: |-
          The original metric is given as a fraction between 0 and 1 (i.e. per-capita). We multiply this by 100 to get a percentage.

        description_from_producer: |-
          Estimates of the population exposed to the risk of death during some age-time interval are based on annual (January 1st) population estimates, with small corrections that reflect the timing of deaths during the interval. Period exposure estimations are based on assumptions of uniformity in the distribution of events except when historical monthly birth data are available.

      central_death_rate:
        title: Central death rate
        description_short: |-
          For a given population or cohort, the central death rate at age x during a given period of 12 months is found by dividing the number of people who died during this period while aged x by the average number who were living in that age group during the period.
        unit: deaths per capita

        description_short: Number of person-years lived between ages x and x+n.
      number_person_years_remaining:
        title: Number of person-years remaining

      life_expectancy:
        title: Life expectancy
        short_unit: years
        unit: years
        description_short: Period life expectancy at exact age x (in years).
      exposure:
        title: Exposure-to-risk
        unit: person-years
        description_short: Total person-years lived in the age interval [x, x + 1) during calendar year t.
        description_from_producer: |-
          Estimates of the population exposed to the risk of death during some agetime interval are based on annual (January 1st) population estimates, with small corrections that reflect the timing of deaths during the interval. Period exposure estimations are based on assumptions of uniformity in the distribution of events except when historical monthly birth data are available.

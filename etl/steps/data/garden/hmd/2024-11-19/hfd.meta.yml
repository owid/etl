          - The TFR has been adjusted using a method proposed by [Bongaarts-Feeney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-replacement_fertility). It sums order-specific TFRs and adjusts for changes in the mean age of order-specific fertility schedule.
          - The tempo-adjusted TFR adjusts for timing shifts in childbearing, such as postponement of births.
          - The tempo-adjusted TFR helps to distinguish between changes in the number of children women have and changes in the timing of when they have them.
          - The tempo-adjusted TFR often displays large year-to-year fluctuations ([Sobotka 2003](https://www.demographic-research.org/articles/volume/8/6)), which can make its use for specific years problematic. Therefore, three- or five-year moving averages are often used to smooth out fluctuations.
          - Requires careful interpretation, as the adjustment is based on specific assumptions about timing effects.

          We have estimated the share of women with N births using the estimates on the cohort parity progression ratio (ppr). ppr(N) is an estimate on the probability of giving birth to an Nth child, conditioned on having had N-1 children before.

          Considering all of this, we have estimated the share of women with N births as:

          share of women with N births = ppr(1) * ppr(2) * ··· * ppr(N) * [1 - ppr(N+1)]

          Note that we need the [1 - ppr(N+1)] term to not count women that had more than N births.

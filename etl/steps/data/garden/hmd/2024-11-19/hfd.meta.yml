          The average number of {definitions.others.bo_1}children a woman would have in her lifetime if she experienced the fertility rates of a specific year.
        unit: "births per woman"
        description_key:
          - Assumes current age-specific fertility rates remain constant throughout a woman's lifetime.
          - Does not account for potential changes in social, economic, or health conditions that could affect fertility rates.

        unit: "births per woman"

        title: "Tempo-adjusted total fertility rates"
        description_short: |-
          The total fertility rate adjusted to account for delays or advances in childbearing.
        unit: "births per woman"
        description_key:
          - The TFR has been adjusted using a method proposed by Bongaarts-Feeneysted. It sums order-specific TFRs and adjusts for changes in the mean age of order-specific fertility schedule.
          - Adjusts for timing shifts in childbearing, such as postponement of births.
          - Helps to distinguish between changes in the number of children women have and changes in the timing of when they have them.
          - The tempo-adjusted TFR often displays large year-to-year fluctuations (Sobotka 2003), which can make its use for specific years problematic. Therefore, three- or five-year moving averages are often used to smooth out fluctuations.
          - Requires careful interpretation, as the adjustment is based on specific assumptions about timing effects.

      patfr:
        title: "Parity- and age-adjusted total fertility rate"
        description_short: |-
          The total fertility rate adjusted for both the age of the mother and the number of children she already has.
        unit: "births per woman"
        description_key:
          - Accounts for both the age structure and parity distribution of the female population.
          - Provides a more nuanced view of fertility compared to the unadjusted total fertility rate.

        title: "Period mean ages at birth"
        description_short: |-
          The average age of mothers when they give birth in a specific year. It is standardized for the age structure of the female population of reproductive age.

      mab40:
        title: "Period mean ages at birth by age 40"
        description_short: |-
          The average age of mothers when they give birth, calculated only up to age 40. It is standardized for the age structure of the female population of reproductive age.
        unit: "years"
        description_key:
          - Focuses on childbearing occurring before age 40, providing insights into early fertility patterns.
      sdmab:
        title: "Standard deviation in period mean ages at birth"
        description_short: |-
          How much variation there is in the ages of mothers when they give birth in a specific year.
        unit: "years"
        description_key:
          - Measures the spread of ages at which women give birth.
          - A low standard deviation indicates that most births occur around the same age, while a high standard deviation suggests a wider range of ages.
          - Useful for understanding the diversity of reproductive timing.
      sdmab40:
        title: "Standard deviation in period mean ages at birth by age 40"
        description_short: |-
          How much variation there is in the ages of mothers when they give birth, calculated only up to age 40.
        unit: "years"
        description_key:
          - Reflects variability in the timing of births up to age 40.
          - Helps to understand how concentrated or spread out early childbearing is within the population.
      tmab:
        title: "Period table mean ages at birth"
        description_short: |-
          The average age of mothers at birth, considering the number of children they already have.
        unit: "years"
        description_key:
          - Derived from fertility tables that account for both age and parity.
          - Provides a more detailed understanding of the timing of births across different birth orders.

        title: "Crude birth rate"
        description_short: The number of live births per 1,000 people in a given year. It is not standardized for the age structure of the population.
        unit: "births per 1,000 people"
        description_key:
          - The rate is calculated by dividing the total number of live births occurring in a given year by person-years lived by all population in that year.
          - Simple measure of birth intensity, not adjusted for age or parity.
          - It is influenced by the age structure of the population, which can make comparisons between populations challenging.
      b:
        title: "Total live births"
        description_short: The total number of live births recorded in a given year.
        unit: "births"
        description_key:
          - Represents the total number of live births without considering age or parity.
          - Serves as a foundational statistic for calculating other fertility measures.
          - Can be influenced by population size and structure.

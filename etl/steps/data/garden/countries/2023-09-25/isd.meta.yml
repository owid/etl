          We assign each sovereign state to a region based on the mapping (using ISD/COW codes):

            - Americas: 2-165
            - Europe: 200-395, 2558, 3375
            - Africa: 400-626, 4044-6257
            - Middle East: 630-698, 6821-6845
            - Asia and Oceania: 700-990, 7003-9210

          We also provide the following extra regions (note that this overlap with 'Africa' and 'Middle East'). These regions are used in Project Mars dataset.

            - North Africa and the Middle East: 435-436, 483, 600-698, 4352-4354, 4763, 4832, 6251-6845

      borders:
        title: Had borders
        description_from_producer: |-
          Is there evidence that the state had clearly defined borders separating it from other states or sources of authority?

    variables:
      cowid:
        title: COW ID
        description_from_producer: |-
          A three-letter abbreviation given by the COW dataset. For new cases, a COW ID was created.
      statename:

        title: Other Name
        description_from_producer: |-
          Other names by which the state is known
      isd_category:
        title: ISD Category
        description_from_producer: |-
          Category 1 states have same start and end years as ISD V1. Category 2 states were in ISD V1 but have changed start and/or end years. Category 3 states are new states that were not in ISD V1.
      region:
        title: Region
        description_from_producer: |-
          The COW index number for the geographic region in which the state is located.
      start_am:

        title: EStart
        description_from_producer: |-

      declare:
        title:
        description_from_producer: |-
          Is there evidence of a declaration of independence? (0=no, 1=yes). It can be a pronouncement or a document. By listing “1” for this variable you are directing the future researcher to a case where something occurred.

          May produce false negatives. For example, a “1” indicated that evidence was found for the variable “Border.” A “0” indicates that no evidence was found, NOT that borders did not exist in this case.
      decdate:
        title: DecDate
        description_from_producer: |-
          Date of the declaration of independence (provide year and date if possible).

          May produce false negatives. For example, a “1” indicated that evidence was found for the variable “Border.” A “0” indicates that no evidence was found, NOT that borders did not exist in this case.

    variables:
      cowid:
        title: COW ID
        description_from_producer: |-
          A three-letter abbreviation given by the COW dataset. For new cases, a COW ID was created.

        description_from_producer: |-
          Other names by which the state is known.
      isd_category:
        title: ISD category
        description_from_producer: |-
          Category 1 states have same start and end years as ISD V1. Category 2 states were in ISD V1 but have changed start and/or end years. Category 3 states are new states that were not in ISD V1.
      region:
        title: COW Region

        description_from_producer: |-
          Is there evidence of a declaration of independence? (0=no, 1=yes). It can be a pronouncement or a document. By listing “1” for this variable you are directing the future researcher to a case where something occurred.

          May produce false negatives. For example, a “1” indicated that evidence was found for the variable “Border.” A “0” indicates that no evidence was found, NOT that borders did not exist in this case.

        title: Date of the declaration of independence
        description_from_producer: |-
          Date of the declaration of independence (provide year and date if possible).

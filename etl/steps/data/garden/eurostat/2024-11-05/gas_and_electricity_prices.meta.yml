    "Energy and supply" is the cost of natural gas, including the commodity price paid by the supplier or the price at the point of entry into the transmission system. It also includes, where applicable, end-user costs such as storage and expenses related to the sale of gas to final customers.
  description_key_gas_component_network_cost: &description_key_gas_component_network_cost |
    "Network costs" include the tariffs for transmission and distribution, costs from transmission and distribution losses, and system-related expenses such as after-sale services, system services, meter rental, and metering.
  description_key_gas_component_vat: &description_key_gas_component_vat |
    "Value-added tax (VAT)" is a consumption tax applied to the final price of gas or electricity, as defined in Council Directive 2006/112/EC.
  description_key_gas_component_renewable_taxes: &description_key_gas_component_renewable_taxes |
    "Renewable taxes" are taxes, fees, levies, or charges that promote renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, and combined heat and power (CHP) generation.
  description_key_gas_component_capacity_taxes: &description_key_gas_component_capacity_taxes |

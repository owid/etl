          - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is the world's largest dedicated independent semiconductor foundry.
          - This dataset contains comprehensive quarterly operating metrics including capacity, wafer shipments, and revenue breakdowns.
          - For Annual Capacity and Quarterly Wafer Shipments, values are in thousands of 12-inch equivalent wafers.
          - For revenue breakdown metrics (by technology, platform, geography), values represent percentages of total revenue.
          - Revenue breakdown by technology shows the percentage of wafer revenue from different process nodes (3nm, 5nm, 7nm, etc.).
          - Revenue breakdown by platform shows percentage of net revenue from High Performance Computing, Smartphone, IoT, Automotive, etc.
          - Revenue breakdown by geography shows percentage of net revenue by region (North America, China, Asia Pacific, Japan, EMEA).
          - Data coverage begins in 1994 with varying levels of detail across different time periods.

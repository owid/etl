            Annual production capacity measured in thousands of 12-inch equivalent wafers. Represents TSMC's total manufacturing capability across all fabrication facilities.
            <% elif category == "shipments" %>
            Quarterly wafer shipments measured in thousands of 12-inch equivalent wafers. Represents actual production output delivered to customers each quarter and is a key indicator of TSMC's production utilization.
            <% elif category == "technology" %>
            Percentage of wafer revenue from this process node technology. Smaller nanometer values represent more advanced, cutting-edge manufacturing processes. Advanced nodes (3nm, 5nm, 7nm) command higher prices and are used in high-performance applications, while mature nodes (28nm and above) serve specialized applications and legacy products.
            <% elif category == "platform" %>
            Percentage of net revenue from this application platform. Shows TSMC's revenue distribution across different end-use markets. High Performance Computing includes AI accelerators, data center processors, and graphics cards.
            <% elif category == "geography" %>
            Percentage of net revenue from this geographic region. Reflects customer location and regional demand patterns. North America includes major customers like Apple, Nvidia, and AMD.

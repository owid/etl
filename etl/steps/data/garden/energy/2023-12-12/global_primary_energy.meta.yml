      - All data prior to the year 1965 is sourced from Smil (2017). All data from 1965 onwards, with the exception of traditional biomass is sourced from the Statistical Review. Smil's estimates of traditional biomass are only available until 2015. For the years 2016 onwards, we have assumed a similar level of traditional biomass consumption. This is approximately in line with recent trends in traditional biomass from Smil's data.
      - We normalize all Statistical Review fossil fuels data to terawatt-hours (TWh) using a conversion factor of 1,000,000 / 3,600 (~277.778) to convert from exajoules (EJ) to TWh.

      - "Primary energy data can be quantified using two different methodologies:
        (1) 'Direct' primary energy, which directly combined fossil fuel data with the electricity generated by nuclear power and renewables.
        (2) 'Substituted' primary energy, which converts non-fossil electricity into their 'input equivalents': The amount of primary energy that would be needed if they had the same inefficiencies as fossil fuels. This 'substitution method' is adopted by the Statistical Review of World Energy when all data is compared in exajoules."

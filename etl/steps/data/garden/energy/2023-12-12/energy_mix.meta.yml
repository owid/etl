    Primary energy is measured using the "substitution method" (also called "input-equivalent" primary energy). This method is used for non-fossil sources of electricity (namely renewables and nuclear), and measures the amount of fossil fuels that would be required by thermal power stations to generate the same amount of non-fossil electricity.
    For example, if a country's nuclear power generated 100 TWh of electricity, and assuming that the efficiency of a standard thermal power plant is 38%, the input-equivalent primary energy for this country would be 100 TWh / 0.38 = 263 TWh = 0.95 EJ. This input-equivalent primary energy takes account of the inefficiencies in fossil fuel production and provides a better approximation of each source's share of energy consumption. You can find more details in [the Statistical Review of World Energy's methodology document](https://www.energyinst.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/1055541/Methodology.pdf).
  # Key description item for biofuels.

    Includes biogasoline (such as ethanol) and biodiesel. Volumes have been adjusted for energy content.
  # Processing description for all quantities measuring annual change.
  description_processing_annual_change: &description_processing_annual_change |-
    The annual change in energy consumption by source is calculated as the difference with respect to the previous year.
  # Processing description for all per capita quantities.
  description_processing_per_capita: &description_processing_per_capita |-
    Per capita figures are calculated by dividing by a population dataset that is built and maintained by Our World in Data, based on [different sources](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources).

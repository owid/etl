      All data prior to 1985 (and prior to 1965 in the case of renewables), is sourced from (DUKES).
      All other data is sourced from the the Energy Institute (EI) Statistical Review of World Energy and Ember's Yearly electricity data. Where data from Ember is available for a given year, we rely on it as the primary source. We then supplement this with data from EI where data from Ember is not available.

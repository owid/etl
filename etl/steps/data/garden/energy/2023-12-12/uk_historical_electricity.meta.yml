dataset:
  title: UK historical electricity (DUKES, 2023c)
  description: |
    All data prior to 1985 (and prior to 1965 in the case of renewables), is sourced from [the Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES), published by the UK's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/electricity-chapter-5-digest-of-united-kingdom-energy-statistics-dukes).

    All other data is sourced from the [the Energy Institute (EI) Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review) and [Ember's Yearly Electricity Data](https://ember-climate.org/data-catalogue/yearly-electricity-data/). Where data from Ember is available for a given year, we rely on it as the primary source. We then supplement this with data from EI where data from Ember is not available.

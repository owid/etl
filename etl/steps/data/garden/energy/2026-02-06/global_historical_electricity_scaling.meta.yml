      - We combine historical estimates from Pinto et al. (2023) with Ember's Yearly electricity data. Where data from both sources is available, data from Ember is prioritized.
      - For each electricity source, we identify the first year in which global electricity production surpassed 100 TWh, and track the evolution of global electricity production from that year onward.

          Measured in [terawatt-hours](#dod:watt-hours).
        description_key:
          - Each electricity source is tracked from the first year in which its global electricity production surpassed 100 TWh. For example, wind power surpassed 100 TWh in 2005, and hence the first data point (on year zero) corresponds to wind power's global electricity production in 2005; the next data point is wind power's production in 2006, and so on.
          - This means that year zero corresponds to different calendar years for different electricity sources. For example, year zero corresponds to 2005 for wind power, but to 2013 for solar power.

For example, wind power surpassed 100 TWh in 2005, and hence the first data point (on year zero) corresponds to wind power's share of global electricity production in 2005; the next data point is the share in 2006, and so on.

      - The Reserves-to-Production (R/P) Ratio measures the number of years of fuel supplies left based on current annual consumption rates. Note that this can change through time through the discovery of new fuel reserves, and increases in annual consumption.
  description_short_tonnes: &description_short_tonnes |-
    Measured in tonnes.
  description_short_years: &description_short_years |-
    Measured in years.
  description_short_cubic_meters: &description_short_cubic_meters |-
    Measured in cubic meters.

  short_name: electricity_mix
  description: |
    Data is compiled by Our World in Data based on three main sources:
    – [BP Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html).
    – [Ember Global Electricity Review (2022)](https://ember-climate.org/data-catalogue/yearly-electricity-data/).
    – [Ember European Electricity Review (2022)](https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/european-electricity-review-2022/).

    Ember compile their global dataset from various sources including:
    – Eurostat: Annual European generation and import data, and monthly data in some cases where better sources are not available.
    – ENTSO-E: Monthly European generation and import data.
    – EIA: Annual global generation and import data.
    – UN: Monthly global generation data in some cases.
    – GEM: Annual global coal and gas capacity data.
    – IRENA: Annual global capacity data for all non-fossil fuel types, and for Other Fossil where available.
    – WRI: Annual global capacity data for Other Fossil where other sources are not available.
    – European carbon intensities rely on data from the European Environment Agency (EEA).
    – A complete list of data sources for each individual country in Ember's Global Electricity Review can be found [here](https://ember-climate.org/app/uploads/2022/03/GER22-Methodology.pdf).
    – A complete list of data sources for each individual country in Ember's European Electricity Review can be found [here](https://ember-climate.org/app/uploads/2022/02/EER-Methodology.pdf).

    We rely on BP as the primary source of electricity consumption data for two reasons. BP provides primary energy (not just electricity) consumption data, and it provides a longer time-series (dating back to 1965) than Ember (which only dates back to 1990). However, BP does not provide data for all countries. So, where data from BP is available for a given country and year, we rely on it as the primary source. We then supplement this with data from Ember where data from BP is not available.

    Our World in Data has converted absolute electricity production by source to the share in the mix by dividing each by total electricity production.

    BP's region definitions sometimes differ from Our World in Data's definitions. For example, BP's North America includes only Canada, Mexico and United States, whereas Our World in Data's North America includes countries in Central America (see a map with [our region definitions](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions)). For this reason, we include in the dataset regions like "North America (BP)" to refer to BP's original data using their definition of the region, as well as "North America", which is data aggregated by Our World in Data using our definition. These aggregates are constructed by adding up (when possible) the contributions from the countries in the region.

    [BP's region definitions](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/using-the-review/definitions-and-explanatory-notes.html#accordion_Regional%20definitions), denoted with "(BP)", are:
    * "Asia Pacific (BP)": Brunei, Cambodia, China (Mainland), China Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region), China Macau SAR (Special Administrative Region), Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, North Korea, Philippines, Singapore, South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka), South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Oceania.
    * "Australasia (BP)": Australia, New Zealand.
    * "CIS (BP)" - Commonwealth of Independent States: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan.
    * "Caribbean (BP)": Atlantic islands between the US Gulf Coast and South America, including Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands and Bermuda.
    * "Central America (BP)": Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama
    * "Eastern Africa (BP)": Territories on the east coast of Africa from Sudan to Mozambique. Also Madagascar, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe.
    * "Europe (BP)": European members of the OECD plus Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Georgia, Gibraltar, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Ukraine.
    * "Middle Africa (BP)": Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Sao Tome & Principe.
    * "Middle East (BP)": Arabian Peninsula, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria.
    * "Non-OECD (BP)" - Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development: All countries that are not members of the OECD.
    * "North America (BP)": US (excluding US territories), Canada, Mexico
    * "Northern Africa (BP)": Territories on the north coast of Africa from Egypt to Western Sahara.

    * "OPEC (BP)" - Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries: Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Libya, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria, Republic of Congo, Venezuela.
    * "South and Central America (BP)": Caribbean (including Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands), Bermuda, Central and South America.
    * "Southern Africa (BP)": Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland.
    * "Western Africa (BP)": Territories on the west coast of Africa from Mauritania to Nigeria, including Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Mali and Niger.

    Additionally, BP includes some regions that are not explicitly defined (e.g. "Other Europe (BP)", or "Other CIS (BP)"). We define our regions in the following way:
    * "Africa" - All African countries + "Other Africa (BP)".
    * "Asia" - All Asian countries + "Other Middle East (BP)" + "Other CIS (BP)" + "Other Asia Pacific (BP)".
    * "Europe" - All European countries + "Other Europe (BP)".
    * "North America" - All North American countries + "Other Caribbean (BP)" + "Other North America (BP)".
    * "Oceania" - All Oceanian countries.
    * "South America" - All South American countries + "Other South America (BP)".
    Where the individual countries in each region are defined [in this map](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions). Additional BP regions are ignored, since they belong to other regions already included (e.g. the data for "Other Western Africa (BP)" is included in "Other Africa (BP)"). Finally, income groups are constructed following the definitions [in this map](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-banks-income-groups).

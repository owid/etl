    Photovoltaic cost and capacity data between 1975 and 2003 has been taken from Nemet (2009).

    Prices from Nemet (2009) have been converted to 2021 US$ using the US GDP deflator: https://www.multpl.com/gdp-deflator/table/by-year

    Photovoltaic cost data between 2004 and 2009 has been taken from Farmer & Lafond (2016).

    According to Farmer & Lafond (2016), the data are mostly taken from the [Santa-Fe Performance Curve DataBase](https://pcdb.santafe.edu/). The database has been constructed from personal communications and from [Colpier and Cornland (2002)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0095), [Goldemberg et al. (2004)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0130), [Lieberman (1984)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0180), [Lipman and Sperling (1999)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0190), [Zhao (1999)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0310), [McDonald and Schrattenholzer (2001)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0205), [Neij et al. (2003)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0235), [Moore (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0215), [Nemet (2006)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0240), [Schilling and Esmundo (2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0265). The data on photovoltaic prices has been collected from public releases of Strategies Unlimited, Navigant and SPV Market Research. The data on nuclear energy is from [Koomey and Hultman (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0165) and [Cooper (2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0100). The DNA sequencing data is from [Wetterstrand (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0290) (cost per human-size genome), and for each year the last available month (September for 2001-2002 and October afterwards) was taken and corrected for inflation using the US GDP deflator.

    Photovoltaic capacity data between 2004 and 2021 has been taken from IRENA.

    Photovoltaic cost data between 2010 and 2021 has been taken from IRENA.

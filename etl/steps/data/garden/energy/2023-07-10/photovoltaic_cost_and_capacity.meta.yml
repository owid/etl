  title: Solar photovoltaic cost and capacity (Energy, 2023b)
  description: |
    Photovoltaic cost and capacity data between 1975 and 2003 has been taken from Nemet (2009).

    Prices from Nemet (2009) have been converted to 2021 US$ using the US GDP deflator: https://www.multpl.com/gdp-deflator/table/by-year

    Photovoltaic cost data between 2004 and 2009 has been taken from Farmer & Lafond (2016).

    According to Farmer & Lafond (2016), the data are mostly taken from the Santa-Fe Performance Curve DataBase, accessible at <a href="pcdb.santafe.edu">pcdb.santafe.edu</a>. The database has been constructed from personal communications and from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0095">Colpier and Cornland (2002)</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0130">Goldemberg et al.

The data on photovoltaic prices has been collected from public releases of Strategies Unlimited, Navigant and SPV Market Research. The data on nuclear energy is from <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0165">Koomey and Hultman (2007)</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0100">Cooper (2009)</a>.

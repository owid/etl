  title: Electricity mix (EI & Ember, 2023)
  description: |
    Data is compiled by Our World in Data based on three main sources:
    - <a href="https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review">The Energy Institute (EI) Statistical Review of World Energy</a>.
    - <a href="https://ember-climate.org/data-catalogue/yearly-electricity-data/">Ember Yearly Electricity Data</a>.
    - <a href="https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/european-electricity-review-2022/">Ember European Electricity Review</a>.

    Ember compile their global dataset from various sources including:
    - Eurostat: Annual European generation and import data, and monthly data in some cases where better sources are not available.
    - ENTSO-E: Monthly European generation and import data.
    - EIA: Annual global generation and import data.
    - UN: Monthly global generation data in some cases.
    - GEM: Annual global coal and gas capacity data.
    - IRENA: Annual global capacity data for all non-fossil fuel types, and for Other Fossil where available.
    - WRI: Annual global capacity data for Other Fossil where other sources are not available.
    - European carbon intensities rely on data from the European Environment Agency (EEA).
    - A complete list of data sources for each individual country in Ember's Yearly Electricity Data can be found <a href="https://ember-climate.org/app/uploads/2022/07/Ember-Electricity-Data-Methodology.pdf">here</a>.
    - A complete list of data sources for each individual country in Ember's European Electricity Review can be found <a href="https://ember-climate.org/app/uploads/2022/02/EER-Methodology.pdf">here</a>.

    We rely on Ember as the primary source of electricity consumption data. While EI provides primary energy (not just electricity) consumption data and it provides a longer time-series (dating back to 1965) than Ember (which only dates back to 1990), EI does not provide data for all countries or for all sources of electricity (for example, only Ember provides data on electricity from bioenergy). So, where data from Ember is available for a given country and year, we rely on it as the primary source. We then supplement this with data from EI where data from Ember is not available.

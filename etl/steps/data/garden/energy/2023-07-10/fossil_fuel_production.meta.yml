  title: Fossil fuel production (EI & Shift, 2023)
  description: |
    This dataset on fossil fuel production is generated by combining the latest data from <a href="https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review">the Energy Institute Statistical Review of World Energy</a> and <a href="https://www.theshiftdataportal.org/energy">The Shift Dataportal</a>.

    The Energy Institute provides fossil fuel production data from 1965 onwards (and crude prices from 1861 onwards). The Shift Dataportal provides long-term data from 1900, but only extends to 2016.

    To maintain consistency with the energy datasets on Our World in Data, we have taken the Energy Institute data as preference - meaning if they provide data for the given country and year, this data is used. Where data is not available from the Energy Institute for a given country, or pre-1965 we rely on data from The Shift Dataportal.

    We have converted primary production in exajoules to terawatt-hours using the conversion factor: 1,000,000 / 3,600 ~ 278.

    Production per capita has been calculated using a population dataset that is built and maintained by Our World in Data, based on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources">different sources</a>.

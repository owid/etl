  title: Primary energy consumption (EI & EIA, 2023)
  description: |
    Primary energy consumption data was compiled by Our World in Data based on two key data sources:
    1. <a href="https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review">Energy Institute (EI) Statistical Review of World Energy</a>.
    2. <a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/data/world/total-energy/more-total-energy-data">International energy data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)</a>.

    EI provides the longest and most up-to-date time-series of primary energy. However, it does not provide data for all countries. We have therefore supplemented this dataset with energy data from the EIA. Where EI provides data for a given country, this data is adopted; for countries where this data is missing, we rely on EIA energy figures.

    Per capita figures have been calculated using a population dataset that is built and maintained by Our World in Data, based on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources">different sources</a>.

    To calculate energy per unit of GDP, we use total real GDP figures from <a href="https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/releases/maddison-project-database-2020">the Maddison Project Database, version 2020</a>.

        title: Annual number of objects launched into outer space
        unit: objects

        description_short: "Annual number of satellites, probes, landers, crewed spacecrafts, and space station flight elements, launched into Earth orbit or beyond."

          - "Objects are defined here as satellites, probes, landers, crewed spacecrafts, and space station flight elements launched into Earth orbit or beyond."
          - "This data is based on national registers of launches submitted to the UN by participating nations. According to UN estimates, the data captures around 88% of all objects launched."
          - "When an object is marked by the source as launched by a country on behalf of another one, the launch is attributed to the latter country."
          - "When a launch is made jointly by several countries, it is recorded in each of these countries' time series but only once in the 'World' series."
        description_processing: |-
          - We scrape the data from the source by iterating through all objects in the online index.
          - We harmonize the names of countries. When an object is marked by the source as launched by a country on behalf of another one, we attribute the launch to the latter country.
          - We aggregate launches by country and year. When a launch is made jointly by several countries, it is recorded in each of these countries' time series.
          - We calculate the total number of launches globally. This is available as 'World' in the data. When a launch is made jointly by several countries, it is only recorded once in the 'World' series.
          - We also calculate the cumulative number of launches over time.

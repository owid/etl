          Objects are subtracted from the time series after they have reentered the Earth's atmosphere. Not all objects are tracked: in 2021, the European Space Agency estimated there were more than 130 million space debris objects larger than 1 millimeter.

          Debris from launches or collisions is not counted. Objects are subtracted from the time series after they have reentered the Earth's atmosphere.

          Objects are subtracted from the time series after they have reentered the Earth's atmosphere. Not all objects are tracked: in 2021, the European Space Agency estimated there were more than 130 million space debris objects larger than 1 millimeter.

    title: Number of non-debris objects in space by orbit
    variables:
      n_objects:
        title: Payloads and rocket bodies in space, by orbit
        description_short: |-
          Debris from launches or collisions is not counted. Objects are subtracted from the time series after they have reentered the Earth's atmosphere.

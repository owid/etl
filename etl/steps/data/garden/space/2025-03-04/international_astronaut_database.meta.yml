    - The definition of astronaut is not universally agreed upon among space launch providers. This data includes all individuals who have flown to outer space.
    - Outer space is defined here as an altitude of 100 kilometers or higher, following the World Air Sports Federation (FAI) definition, an international standard for aeronautics and astronautics records.
    - The data includes astronauts who died during space-bound missions, such as those aboard STS-51-L.
    - This data does not include individuals who flew below 100 kilometers or first-time astronauts who died in non-space-bound missions without having previously been to space.

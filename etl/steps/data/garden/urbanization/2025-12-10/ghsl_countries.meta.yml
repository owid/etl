    The [Degree of Urbanization](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/degurba.php) classifies areas as [cities](#dod:cities-degurba), [towns and suburbs](#dod:towns-degurba), or [rural areas](#dod:rural-areas-degurba) based on population density and settlement size rather than administrative boundaries. Developed by six international organizations and endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission in 2020, it provides consistent definitions for comparing urbanization across countries.

  text_data_source: &text_data_source |-
    The classification uses 1 km² grid cells, combining satellite imagery with census data to map where people actually live.

  text_degurba_caveat: &text_degurba_caveat |-
    Different countries use different definitions and criteria to define urban and rural areas, such as population size, population density, infrastructure, employment patterns, or official city status. The [Degree of Urbanization](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/degurba.php) applies a single global standard using population density grids, meaning its classifications won’t always match official city boundaries and therefore urbanization rates may differ from country-reported figures.

    For small countries, values can change sharply when an entire area shifts from one classification to another.

              Cities are defined as densely populated areas with a minimum density of 1,500 people per square kilometre and at least 50,000 people in total.
              <% elif location_type == 'urban_cluster' %>
              Towns and suburbs are settlements outside cities where people live at moderate density. They have at least 300 people per square kilometre and at least 5,000 people in total. This includes smaller towns, suburban areas, and peri-urban areas around cities.
              <% elif location_type == 'rural_total' %>
              Rural areas are places with less than 300 people per km² or a total population of less than 5,000.
              <% elif location_type == 'urban_total' %>
              Urban areas include both cities (at least 1,500 people per km², 50,000 total) and towns and suburbs (at least 300 people per km², 5,000 total).

            Cities are defined as densely populated areas with a minimum density of 1,500 people per square kilometre and at least 50,000 people in total. Towns and suburbs are settlements outside cities where people live at moderate density. They have at least 300 people per square kilometre and at least 5,000 people in total. Rural areas are everything else.

              Historical estimates (1975–2020) combine census data with satellite imagery of built-up areas from the [Global Human Settlement Layer](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/).

Uncertainty increases further into the future.

      The European Commission integrates satellite imagery with national census data to delineate the boundaries of capital cities and estimate their populations.
      To predict future urbanization (2025 and 2030), both static (land features) and dynamic (past satellite images) components are used to project growth. DEGURBA defines cities by population, not administrative borders, aligning with UN guidelines, though fixed thresholds may not always capture local differences.

  desc_short_density: &desc_short_density |-
    The number of people per km² of land area for the country's capital city.
  desc_processing_density:  &desc_processing_density |-
    Population density was calculated by dividing the population of the country's capital by the total area it covers, providing a measure of the number of people living in each km².

  desc_short_pop: &desc_short_pop |-
    The total number of people living in the country's capital city.

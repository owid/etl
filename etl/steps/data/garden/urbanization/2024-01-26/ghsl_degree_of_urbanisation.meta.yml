      The Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA) is a  method designed for capturing the urban-rural continuum and facilitating international comparisons. Developed by six international organizations and endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission, it employs a two-level classification system.

      The first level categorizes territories into three classes: 1) cities, 2) towns and suburbs, and 3) rural areas. This classification helps distinguish urban areas (cities plus towns and suburbs) from rural areas, emphasizing the distinct differences between towns, semi-dense areas, cities, and rural regions.

      The second level adds granularity by further dividing towns and semi-dense areas into towns and suburban or peri-urban areas, and splitting rural areas into villages, dispersed rural areas, and mostly uninhabited areas.

      The classification process involves two steps. Initially, all 1 km² grid cells are categorized into one of three types: urban centers (contiguous grid cells with a density of at least 1500 inhabitants per km² and a total population of 50,000 or more, defining a city), urban clusters (contiguous grid cells with a density of at least 300 inhabitants per km² and a total population of 5,000 or more, defining a town and suburb), and rural grid cells (defining rural areas). These grid cell types are then used to classify smaller administrative or statistical spatial units.

      This method is used with a residential population grid derived from household point locations, typically from geo-coded censuses or registers. Over 30 countries have published such data, and others are collecting it. If point data is unavailable, a disaggregation grid is used, with accuracy dependent on the spatial unit size.

      Key benefits of the method include defining cities based on population characteristics rather than administrative borders, aligning with the UN's recommendation. It also considers factors beyond population size, recognizing the complexity of urbanization across various fields. For instance, a small, service-rich settlement may be deemed urban, while a larger, agriculture-focused one could be rural.

      Challenges include inconsistencies in defining cities using people or buildings, with the Degree of Urbanisation addressing some limitations of building-based definitions. However, variations in built-up land per capita present difficulties. The method uses fixed population size and density thresholds for consistency and simplicity, though this may not always accurately reflect local urban characteristics.

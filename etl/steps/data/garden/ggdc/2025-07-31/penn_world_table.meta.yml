  note_ppp_adjustment: This data is expressed in [international-$](#dod:int_dollar_abbreviation) at {definitions.ppp_year} prices, using multiple benchmark years to adjust for differences in the cost of living between countries over time.

  description_short_gdp: Total economic output of a country or region per year.
  description_short_gdp_per_capita: Average economic output per person in a country or region per year.

  description_key_gdp: Gross domestic product (GDP) is a measure of the total value added from the production of goods and services in a country or region each year.
  description_key_gdp_per_capita: GDP per capita is GDP divided by population.
  description_key_medium_run: This indicator provides information on economic growth and income levels in the _medium run_. Some country estimates are available as far back as 1950.
  description_key_ppp_adjustment: This data is adjusted for inflation and for differences in living costs between countries.
  description_key_ppp_prices_multiple_benchmarks: This data is expressed in [international-$](#dod:int_dollar_abbreviation) at {definitions.ppp_year} prices, using a multiple benchmark approach that incorporates PPP estimates from all available benchmark years.
  description_key_ppp_prices_single_benchmark: This data is expressed in [international-$](#dod:int_dollar_abbreviation) at {definitions.ppp_year} prices, using a single benchmark approach that incorporates PPP estimates from the most recent benchmark year.
  description_key_ppp_prices_national_accounts: This data is expressed in [international-$](#dod:int_dollar_abbreviation) at {definitions.ppp_year} prices, using an approach that ensures consistency with national accounts data.

  description_key_gdp_maddison: For GDP estimates in the very long run, see the [Maddison Project Database's indicator](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-maddison-project-database).
  description_key_gdp_per_capita_maddison: For GDP per capita estimates in the very long run, see the [Maddison Project Database's indicator](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-maddison-project-database).

  description_key_gdp_worldbank: For more regularly updated estimates of GDP since 1990, see the [World Bank's indicator](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-worldbank).
  description_key_gdp_per_capita_worldbank: For more regularly updated estimates of GDP per capita since 1990, see the [World Bank's indicator](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank).

  description_processing_outliers: |-
    We excluded values considered outliers in the original dataset (`i_outlier = "Outlier"`), due to implausible relative prices (PPPs divided by exchange rates).

  description_processing_bermuda: |-
    Values for Bermuda have been replaced by different GDP estimates (output side, single price benchmark) due to the unusual changes on prices in this country.

  description_processing_gdp_per_capita: |-
    We estimated this indicator as the corresponding value of GDP divided by the population of each country, available in the original dataset.

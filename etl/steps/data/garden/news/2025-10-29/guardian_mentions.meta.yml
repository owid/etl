          Getting the number of articles/entries talking about a certain country has no straightforward answer, since there can be different strategies. The strategy for this indicator is based on first defining a set of country name variations for each country, and then look for content on The Guardian with an explicit mention to these names.


          1. Get all country name variations:
              - Obtain all the country name variations using our standard name list.
              - Our list may not cover all cases, and may contain some names that are not valid on The Guardian API (e.g. names with symbols like ';' are not supported). Therefore, we clean this list.

          2. For each country, obtain the number of pages using each set of name variations. Steps:
              - For each country and year we get all content metadata: a query like "https://content.guardianapis.com/search?q=...&from-date=2020-01-01&to-date=2020-12-31" for year 2020. The count of pages is in the property `response.total`.

          You can learn more by looking at the queries used for each country in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/owid/etl/blob/master/snapshots/news/2025-10-29/country_queries.yaml)

      num_pages_per_million:
        title: Number of pages in the Guardian that mention a country (per million people)
        unit: "pages per million people"
        description_short: Number of pages in the Guardian that mention a particular country, normalized by the population of the country.
        description_processing: *desc_proc_2

      relative_pages:
        title: Share of pages in The Guardian that mention a country
        unit: "pages per 100,000 pages"
        description_short: Share of pages in The Guardian that that mention a particular country.
        description_processing: *desc_proc_2

      relative_pages_excluded:
        title: Share of pages in The Guardian that mention a country (excludes UK, US, Australia)
        unit: "pages per 100,000 pages"
        description_short: Share of pages in The Guardian that are tagged with a country-related label. Excludes US, UK and Australia.
        description_processing: |-
          {tables.guardian_mentions.variables.num_pages.description_processing}

          This estimates exclude the UK, US, and Australia from the total number of pages. The reason for this is because the Guardian is a UK-based newspaper, and it is expected to have a higher number of articles about the UK, US, and Australia.

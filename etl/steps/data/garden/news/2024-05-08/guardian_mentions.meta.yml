          Getting the number of articles/entries talking about a certain country has no straightforward answer, since there can be different strategies. The strategy for this indicator is based on first getting all the tags for a country, and then getting the number of articles that have those tags.


          1. Obtain all tags that concern a country:
              - Obtain all the tag pages that have a title starting with a country name: a query like "https://content.guardianapis.com/tags?web-title=spain", for Spain. As a result we obtain a mapping that tells us for each country the list of tags (e.g. "Spain: [world/spain, travel/spain, etc.]") in use.
              - We work with a list of ~240 countries.
              - Getting the right country names has been an iterative process, trying to align our standard country names with the Guardian's.

          2. For each country, obtain the number of pages using each set of tags. Steps:
              - For each country and year we get all content metadata: a query like "https://content.guardianapis.com/search?tags=...&from-date=2020-01-01&to-date=2020-12-31" for year 2020. The count of pages is in the property `response.total`.

      relative_pages_tags:
        title: Share of pages in the Guardian with a country tag
        unit: "pages per 100,000 pages"
        description_short: Share of pages in The Guardian that are tagged with a country-related label.
        description_processing: *desc_proc_1

      relative_pages_tags_excluded:
        title: Share of pages in the Guardian with a country tag (excludes UK, US, Australia)
        unit: "pages per 100,000 pages"
        description_short: Share of pages in The Guardian that are tagged with a country-related label. Excludes US, UK and Australia.
        description_processing: |-
          {{ tables.guardian_mentions.variables.num_pages_tags.description_processing }}

          This estimates exclude the UK, US, and Australia from the total number of pages. The reason for this is because the Guardian is a UK-based newspaper, and it is expected to have a higher number of articles about the UK, US, and Australia.

      num_pages_mentions:
        title: Number of pages in the Guardian that mention a country
        unit: pages
        description_short: Number of pages in the Guardian that mention a particular country.
        description_processing: &desc_proc_2 |-
          Getting the number of articles/entries talking about a certain country has no straightforward answer, since there can be different strategies. The strategy for this indicator is based on first defining a set of country name variations for each country, and then look for content on The Guardian with an explicit mention to these names.


          1. Get all country name variations:
              - Obtain all the country name variations using our standard name list.
              - Our list may not cover all cases, and may contain some names that are not valid on The Guardian API (e.g. names with symbols like ';' are not supported). Therefore, we clean this list.

          2. For each country, obtain the number of pages using each set of name variations. Steps:
              - For each country and year we get all content metadata: a query like "https://content.guardianapis.com/search?q=...&from-date=2020-01-01&to-date=2020-12-31" for year 2020. The count of pages is in the property `response.total`.

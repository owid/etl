    This data represents official WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage (WUENIC). The estimates include all WHO Member States, even those that did not report 2023 data. For non-reporting countries, WHO uses statistical methods to extrapolate from previously reported data, ensuring global coverage can be assessed.
  description_key_standard_two: |-
    Global and regional vaccination coverage is calculated using population-weighted averages. In 2023, approximately 5% of countries did not report data, requiring extrapolation from their 2022 data to maintain complete global estimates.
  description_key_standard_three: |-
    These estimates synthesize multiple data sources: officially reported administrative data (based on health facility reports), coverage surveys that meet WHO quality criteria, and contextual information about vaccine supply disruptions or schedule changes. The quality and reliability of these estimates depend on the completeness and accuracy of country reporting systems.

    Measles is one of the most contagious diseases. The first dose of measles vaccine is critical for building immunity. In countries where the national schedule recommends the first dose at 12 months or later based on local epidemiology, these estimates reflect the percentage of children who received their first dose as recommended.
    <%- elif antigen == "RCV1" %>
    Coverage estimates are based on WHO and UNICEF data for the first dose of the measles-rubella vaccine. These are taken from measles vaccine data, so country-reported rubella coverage is not used.
    <%- elif antigen == "HEPB_BD" %>
    Estimates of hepatitis B birth dose coverage are produced only for countries with a universal birth dose policy. Estimates are not produced for countries that recommend a birth dose to infants born to HepB virus-infected mothers only or where there is insufficient information to determine whether vaccination is within 24 hours of birth.
    <%- elif antigen == "PCV3" %>
    In some countries, coverage may show the percentage of infants who received two doses of pneumococcal vaccine before their first birthday, based on national schedules and disease patterns.
    <%- elif antigen == "IPV1" %>
    In countries using both IPV and OPV in their immunization schedules, WHO and UNICEF count any infant under 1 year who received at least one routine dose of IPV in their IPV1 estimates. In countries using only IPV, IPV1 refers to the first IPV dose. These estimates began in 2015 and do not affect the reported coverage for the third polio dose (Pol3). For countries using three doses of IPV, Pol3 coverage equals coverage with three IPV doses. In countries using a mix of IPV and OPV, Pol3 reflects coverage with any third polio vaccine dose, regardless of type.

    This chart shows official estimates of national immunization coverage published by the WHO and UNICEF. The estimates include all WHO member states, even those that did not report 2023 data. For non-reporting countries, WHO uses statistical methods to extrapolate from previously reported data, ensuring global coverage can be assessed.
  description_key_standard_two: |-
    Global and regional vaccination coverage is calculated using population-weighted averages. In 2023, approximately 5% of countries did not report data, requiring extrapolation from their 2022 data to maintain complete global estimates.
  description_key_standard_three: |-
    These estimates combine several sources: official administrative data from health facilities, coverage surveys that meet WHO quality standards, and other relevant information like vaccine supply issues or schedule changes. The accuracy of these estimates depends on how complete and reliable each country’s reporting systems are.

    Measles is one of the most contagious diseases. The first dose of measles vaccine is critical for building immunity. In countries where the national schedule recommends the first dose at 12 months or later based on local epidemiology, these estimates reflect the percentage of children who received their first dose as recommended.
    <% elif antigen == "BCG" %>
    The WHO recommends BCG vaccination at birth for all newborns in countries or settings with a high incidence of TB and/or high leprosy burden. Countries with low TB incidence or leprosy burden may choose to selectively vaccinate newborns in high-risk groups.
    <%- elif antigen == "RCV1" %>
    Rubella coverage estimates are based on WHO and UNICEF data for the first dose of the measles-rubella (MR) vaccine, which is recommended by the WHO.
    <%- elif antigen == "HEPB_BD" %>
    WHO and UNICEF only estimate coverage of the hepatitis B birth dose (a vaccine given within 24 hours of birth) for countries with a policy to provide this dose for all newborns. They don’t produce estimates for countries that only recommend this dose for babies born to mothers infected with hepatitis B, or for countries where there isn’t enough information to know whether the vaccine is given within 24 hours of birth.
    <%- elif antigen == "PCV3" %>
    In some countries, the vaccine schedule may recommend two doses before the age of one, followed by a booster at a later date. These later doses are also included in this variable.
    <%- elif antigen == "IPV1" %>
    In countries where both types of polio vaccine are used — IPV (inactivated polio vaccine, given as an injection) and OPV (oral polio vaccine, given as drops) — WHO and UNICEF count any baby under 1 year old who received at least one routine dose of IPV in their estimate of “first dose” coverage (meaning the first dose of IPV). In countries that only use IPV, “first dose” simply refers to the first IPV dose given.

      Measles is a highly contagious viral disease, most common in young children. Its effects include blindness, inflammation of the brain, severe diarrhea, and severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia. The recommended age for the second dose varies by country.

      Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease.

      Haemophilus influenzae type B is a bacterium responsible for severe pneumonia, meningitis and other invasive diseases almost exclusively in children younger than five years.
    <%- elif antigen == "PCV3" %>
      Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines protect against diseases caused by the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterium. This bacterium causes several common diseases, including meningitis, septicaemia, and pneumonia. It is most common in young children and the elderly.

      Polio is a highly infectious viral disease. The polio virus invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis.

      Rubella is a contagious viral infection that occurs most often in children and young adults. A rubella infection in pregnant women may cause fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome.

      Rotavirus is a virus that causes severe diarrhea, mostly in infants and young children. It can lead to dehydration and death if not treated.

      Coverage estimates include only countries where the WHO recommends vaccination for all newborns. Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. It is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide.
    <%- elif antigen in ["DTPCV1", "DTPCV3"] %>
      Diphtheria can cause breathing problems, heart failure, paralysis, and even death. Tetanus causes painful muscle stiffness and lockjaw. Pertussis (whooping cough) causes severe coughing fits that can lead to pneumonia, seizures, and brain damage.

        description_short: The number of cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) per 100,000 children aged 15 or under, not attributed to polio, that were detected and reported to the WHO.
        description_key:
          - Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance is the gold standard for detecting cases of poliomyelitis.
          - At least one case of non-polio AFP should be detected annually per 100,000 population aged less than 15 years. In endemic regions, to ensure even higher sensitivity, this rate should be two per 100 000.

          - A country is considered to have adequate screening if it has a non-polio AFP rate of at least 2 per 100,000 children aged 15 or under.
          - A country is considered to have adequate testing if it has a percentage adequate stool collection of at least 80%.
          - Countries are labelled 'low risk' if they were considered low risk by the risk assessment carried out for the [2022 GPEI surveillance action plan.](https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GPSAP-2022-2024-EN.pdf)

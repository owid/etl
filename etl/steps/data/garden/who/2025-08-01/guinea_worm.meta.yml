          - A disease outbreak is endemic in a country if it is consistently present in the country. Countries labeled pre-certification are endemic countries that have reported zero indigenous cases in the calendar year. Countries labeled pending surveillance have not had sufficient testing to determine their status or the number of cases in the country.

          A case of guinea-worm disease is a person exhibiting a skin lesion with emergence of a Guinea worm,
          and in which the worm is confirmed in laboratory tests to be D. medinensis. That person is counted as a case
          only once during the calendar year, i.e. when the first worm emerges from that person.

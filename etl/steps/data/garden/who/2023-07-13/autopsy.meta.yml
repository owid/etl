    Since the mid-1980s, Member States of the WHO European Region have been reporting essential health-related statistics
    to the Health for All (HFA) family of databases, making it one of WHOâ€™s oldest sources of data. As it is based on reported
    data, rather than estimates, the HFA family of databases is also particularly valuable.


    HFA databases bring together the indicators that are part of major monitoring frameworks relevant to the Region, such
    as Health 2020 and the Sustainable Development Goals. The indicators cover basic demographics, health status, health determinants
    and risk factors, as well as health care resources, expenditures and more.

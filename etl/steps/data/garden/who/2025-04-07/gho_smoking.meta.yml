    age_standardization: To allow for comparisons between countries and over time, this metric is [age-standardized](#dod:age_standardized).
    users: The number of current smokers/tobacco users is estimated by multiplying the prevalence of smoking/tobacco use by the population aged 15 years and older.
    regional_aggregates: We calculate regional aggregates as population weighted averages of the country-level estimates. The populations is based on the UN World Population Prospects 2024, the regions we use are defined [here](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions#our-world-in-data).
    survey_data: This estimate is based on national surveys conducted within the last 10 years. The WHO uses the survey data as the basis for a statistical regression model to estimate the prevalence of smoking in the adult population for each year and country. Where no or only incomplete survey data is available, the model uses data from similar countries to estimate the prevalence of smoking. You can find more information about the methodology in the [WHO publication](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60264-1/abstract)
    smoking_risks: Smoking is a [risk factor](#dod:risk-factor) for chronic complications, including cancers, [cardiovascular disease](#dod:cvd), and premature death.

        title: Taxes as a share of cigarette price
        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
        description_short: Share of taxes on the retail price of a pack of cigarettes. This includes all taxes and is based on one pack (20 cigarettes) of the most sold brand in the country.
        presentation:
          grapher_config:
            note: "In Canada and the USA, the tax share is calculated as the sum of federal and state taxes."
        description_from_producer: |- # This data comes from https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/gho-tobacco-control-raise-taxes-national-taxes-pack-of-20
          ##### Rationale
          Purpose of this data collection is to monitor the price of tobacco and nicotine products. Monitoring prices of those products helps estimate the burden of applicable indirect/consumption taxes to those products. This also helps monitor change in affordability of those products over time.

          ##### Definition
          Prices were collected of the most sold brand of cigarettes (pack of 20 sticks).

          Primary collection of price data in this report involved surveying two types of retail outlets from the capital city of each country, defined as follows:

          Supermarket/hypermarket: chain or independent retail outlets with a selling space of over 2500 square metres and a primary focus on selling food/beverages/tobacco and other groceries. Hypermarkets also sell a range of non-grocery merchandise.
          Kiosk/newsagent/tobacconist/independent food store: small convenience stores, retail outlets selling predominantly food, beverages and tobacco or a combination of these (e.g. kiosk, newsagent or tobacconist) or a wide range of predominantly grocery products (independent food stores or independent small grocers).

          Prices were collected in the local currency in each country. The prices were also converted in international dollars at purchasing power parity (PPP) using the International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s World Economic Outlook implied PPP conversion rates for 2022. Prices were also converted in US$ at official exchange rate using IMF’s exchange rate conversion of national currency per US$, end of period data for July 2022.


          ##### Method of measurement
          Prices provided in different quantities (or volume sizes for e-liquids) were standardized to 20 sticks for cigarettes and Heated Tobacco Products (HTPs).

          Prices in local currency were divided by the IMF’s World Economic Outlook implied PPP conversion rates for 2022 for the conversion in international dollars at purchasing power parity (PPP).

          Prices in local currency were also divided by the IMF’s exchange rate conversion of national currency per US$ end of period data for July 2022 for the conversion in US$ at official exchange rates.

          ##### Limitations
          In most countries, national level brand-specific price statistics were not available, thus the retail price data were collected from one supermarket/hypermarket or kiosk/newsagent/tobacconist/independent food store usually in the capital city of the country (where survey respondents were mostly located), therefore potentially not being nationally representative.

        description_short: |-
          The level of bans on tobacco advertising are defined as follows: 1) no ban, or ban that does not cover national TV, radio and print media advertising; 2) ban on national TV, radio and print media advertising only; 3) ban on national TV, radio and print media, as well as on some, but not all other forms of advertising and 4) complete ban on all forms of advertising.

        description_short: |-
          National support for quitting smoking or tobacco use has different levels:
          - Countries in dark blue offer a national quitline and cover costs for nicotine replacement therapy or other services.
          - Countries in light blue cover the costs of some services, but not all.
          - Countries in orange offer some services, but do not cover any costs.

          Categories of indoor public places that are completely covered by smoke-free legislation. This monitors eight types of indoor public places: health care facilities, universities, other educational facilities, government buildings, indoor offices, restaurants, pubs and bars and public transport.

              A smoking ban only counts as complete if it covers all indoor areas under any circumstances and holds nationwide.

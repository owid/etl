    age_standardization: To allow for comparisons between countries and over time, this metric is [age-standardized](#dod:age_standardized).
    users: The number of current smokers/ tobacco users is estimated by multiplying the prevalence of smoking/ tobacco use by the population aged 15 years and older.
    regional_aggregates: We calculate regional aggregates as population weighted averages of the country-level estimates. The populations is based on the UN World Population Prospects 2024, the regions we use are defined [here](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions#our-world-in-data).

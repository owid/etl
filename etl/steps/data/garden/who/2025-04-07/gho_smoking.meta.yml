  notes:
    age_standardization: To allow for comparisons between countries and over time, this metric is [age-standardized](#dod:age_standardized).
    users: The number of current smokers/ tobacco users is estimated by multiplying the prevalence of smoking/ tobacco use by the population aged 15 years and older.
    regional_aggregates: We calculate regional aggregates as population weighted averages of the country-level estimates. The populations is based on the UN World Population Prospects 2024, the regions we use are defined [here](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions#our-world-in-data).
    survey_data: This estimate is based on national surveys conducted within the last 10 years. The WHO uses the survey data as the basis for a statistical regression model to estimate the prevalence of smoking in the adult population for each year and country. Where no or only incomplete survey data is available, the model uses data from similar countries to estimate the prevalence of smoking. You can find more information about the methodology in the [WHO publication](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60264-1/abstract)
    smoking_risks: Smoking is a [risk factor](#dod:risk-factor) for chronic complications, including cancers, [cardiovascular disease](#dod:cvd), and premature death.

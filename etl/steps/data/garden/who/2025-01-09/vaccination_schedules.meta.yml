    <% if description == "Seasonal Influenza vaccine" %>
    Seasonal influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses, leading to symptoms like fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, and fatigue.
    <%- elif description == "IPV (Inactivated polio vaccine)" %>
    Polio is a highly infectious viral disease. The polio virus invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis.
    <%- elif description == "Measles-containing vaccine second dose" %>
    Measles is a highly contagious viral disease, most common in young children. Its effects include blindness, inflammation of the brain, severe diarrhoea, and severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia.
    <%- elif description == "YF (Yellow fever) vaccine" %>
    Only countries with endemic yellow fever require the vaccine in routine immunization programs. Yellow fever is caused by a mosquito-transmitted virus, symptoms include fever, chills, headache, backache, and muscle ache.
    <%- elif description == "Mumps vaccine" %>
    Mumps is a contagious viral disease that primarily affects the salivary glands, causing painful swelling near the jaw and cheeks. Complications can include meningitis, hearing loss, and inflammation of the testes, ovaries, or pancreas.
    <%- elif description == "Rubella vaccine" %>
    Rubella is a contagious viral infection that occurs most often in children and young adults. Rubella infection in pregnant women may cause fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome.
    <%- elif description == "Hepatitis B vaccine" %>
    Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease.
    <%- elif description == "Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type B) vaccine" %>
    Haemophilus influenza type B is a bacteria responsible for severe pneumonia, meningitis and other invasive diseases almost exclusively in children younger than 5 years.
    <%- elif description == "HepB birth dose" %>
    Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease.
    <%- elif description == "IPV (Inactivated polio vaccine) 2nd dose" %>
    Polio is a highly infectious viral disease. The polio virus invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis.
    <%- elif description == "Meningococcal meningitis vaccines (all strains)" %>
    Meningococcal meningitis is a severe bacterial infection of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. It can cause fever, headache, stiff neck, and, without prompt treatment, lead to brain damage, hearing loss, or death.
    <%- elif description == "PPV (Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine)" %>
    The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) protects against serious infections caused by _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, including pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections. It's recommended for people at higher risk of these illnesses, such as babies and adults aged 65 and over.
    <%- elif description == "PCV (Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine)" %>
    Streptococcus pneumoniae is a bacterium that causes a number of common diseases including meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia. It is most common in young children and the elderly.
    <%- elif description == "Japanese Encephalitis" %>
    Japanese encephalitis is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes, primarily affecting the brain. While most cases are mild or asymptomatic, severe cases can lead to high fever, seizures, paralysis, or permanent neurological damage.
    <%- elif description == "Varicella vaccine" %>
    The chickenpox (varicella) vaccine protects against varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox, a highly contagious disease.
    <%- elif description == "aP (acellular pertussis) vaccine" %>
    Pertussis (whooping cough) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by bacteria in the throat and airways. This data relates to the acellular vaccine.
    <%- elif description == "Hepatitis A vaccine" %>
    Hepatitis A is a highly contagious viral infection that affects the liver, causing symptoms like fever, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and jaundice.
    <%- elif description == 'Typhoid' %>
    Typhoid is a serious bacterial infection caused by Salmonella typhi, transmitted through contaminated food or water.
    <%- elif description == "HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) vaccine" %>
    Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common viral infection that can cause genital warts and is linked to several cancers, including cervical, anal, and throat cancers. The HPV vaccine provides effective protection against the most high-risk types of the virus and helps prevent related cancers.
    <%- elif description == "Rotavirus vaccine" %>
    [Rotaviruses](#dod:rotavirus) are the most common cause of diarrheal disease in young children.
    <%- elif description == "Malaria vaccine" %>
    Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes.

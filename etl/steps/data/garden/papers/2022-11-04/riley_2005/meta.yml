  title: Estimates of Regional and Global Life Expectancy, 1800-2001 - Riley (2005)
  description: "Historians and demographers have gone to considerable trouble to reconstruct\
    \ life expectancy in the past in individual countries.\nThis overview collects\
    \ information from a large body of that work and links estimates for historical\
    \ populations to those provided by \nthe United Nations, the World Bank, and other\
    \ sources for 1950â€“2001. The result is a picture of regional and global life expectancy\
    \ \nat birth for selected years from 1800 to 2001. The bibliography of more than\
    \ 700 sources is published separately on the web.\n"

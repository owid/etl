        - Plastic Pollution

  text_modelled_estimate: &text_modelled_estimate
    These estimates are produced by a statistical model that combines geographically detailed data with environmental factors, rather than being directly measured for every country and river. The model was calibrated against field observations of floating macroplastics.

  text_mpw_definition: &text_mpw_definition
    Mismanaged plastic waste is plastic that is littered or inadequately disposed of, meaning it is not securely contained in a landfill or properly managed facility and can enter the environment.

  text_scope_macroplastics: &text_scope_macroplastics
    The model focuses on macroplastics (items typically larger than 0.5 cm) that float on or near the water surface. It does not estimate microplastic transport, riverbed transport, or plastic retained by dams and other river structures.

  text_framework: &text_framework
    The study combines geographically detailed data on mismanaged plastic waste generation with environmental and geographic factors — including precipitation, wind, land use, terrain slope, distance to rivers, river discharge, and distance to the ocean — to estimate how much plastic reaches the ocean via rivers.

  text_emission_probability: &text_emission_probability
    "The probability of emission to the ocean is calculated from three components multiplied together: mobilization on land (driven by precipitation and wind), transport from land to a river (influenced by land use, slope, and distance), and transport through the river network to the ocean (influenced by river size and distance to the coast)."

  text_pe_interpretation: &text_pe_interpretation
    This probability represents the modelled likelihood that mismanaged plastic waste generated at a given location will reach the ocean via rivers within a year, based on local environmental and geographic conditions.

  text_me_definition: &text_me_definition
    Annual emissions for a river basin are calculated by multiplying the mismanaged plastic waste in each grid cell by its emission probability, then summing across the entire basin.

  text_uncertainty_context: &text_uncertainty_context
    Modelled emissions for individual rivers can differ substantially from field-based estimates. The study reports that predictions may vary by around a factor of 4 from observations at a 68% confidence level, and by around a factor of 10 at a 95% confidence level.

  text_exported_waste_caveat: &text_exported_waste_caveat
    These figures do not include plastic waste that is exported overseas for processing, which may be at higher risk of entering the ocean if improperly managed in the destination country.

  text_distribution_context: &text_distribution_context
    The study finds that plastic emissions are distributed across many more rivers than previously estimated. Small urban rivers in coastal areas with high rainfall tend to have the highest emission probabilities, while large rivers contribute a smaller share than earlier models suggested.

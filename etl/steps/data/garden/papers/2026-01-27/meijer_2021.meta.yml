  text_modelled_estimate: &text_modelled_estimate
    These estimates come from a statistical model that combines location-specific data with environmental factors. They are not direct measurements for every country and river.

  text_mpw_definition: &text_mpw_definition
    Mismanaged plastic waste is plastic that is littered or thrown away improperly. It is not securely contained in a landfill or properly managed facility, so it can escape into the environment.

  text_scope_macroplastics: &text_scope_macroplastics
    These estimates focus on larger plastic items (typically bigger than 0.5 cm) that float on or near the water surface. They do not include tiny microplastics, plastic on riverbeds, or plastic stopped by dams.

  text_framework: &text_framework
    The study uses location-specific data on mismanaged plastic waste and combines it with environmental factors. These factors include rainfall, wind, land use, terrain steepness, distance to rivers, river size, and distance to the ocean. This helps estimate how much plastic reaches the ocean through rivers.

  text_emission_probability: &text_emission_probability
    "The chance of plastic reaching the ocean depends on three things: first, whether it gets washed away by rain and wind; second, whether it travels from land into a river (affected by land use, slope, and distance); and third, whether it flows through the river network to the ocean (affected by river size and distance to the coast)."

  text_pe_interpretation: &text_pe_interpretation
    This probability shows the estimated chance that mismanaged plastic waste from a specific location will reach the ocean via rivers within a year. It is based on local environmental and geographic conditions.

  text_me_definition: &text_me_definition
    Annual emissions for a river basin are calculated by multiplying the mismanaged plastic waste in each location by its probability of reaching the ocean, then adding up all locations across the entire basin.

  text_uncertainty_context: &text_uncertainty_context
    These estimates have significant uncertainty and can differ substantially from actual measurements. For example, if a river is estimated to carry 100 tonnes of plastic, the true value could reasonably be anywhere from 25 to 400 tonnes, and in some cases could be as low as 10 or as high as 1,000 tonnes.

  text_exported_waste_caveat: &text_exported_waste_caveat
    These figures do not include plastic waste that is shipped overseas for processing. That exported waste may be at higher risk of entering the ocean if it is not properly managed in the destination country.

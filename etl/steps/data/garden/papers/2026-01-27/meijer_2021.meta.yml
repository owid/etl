      p_e_percent:
        title: Probability of plastic emission into ocean
        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
        description_short: National average probability that mismanaged plastic waste reaches the ocean
        description_key:
          - This is the modeled probability that mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) generated in a country will reach the ocean.
          - It depends on distance to rivers and coast, precipitation, wind, land cover, terrain, and river characteristics.
          - Small island nations and countries with dense river networks tend to have higher probabilities.

      me_tons_per_year:
        title: Plastic emitted into ocean via rivers
        unit: metric tons per year
        short_unit: t
        description_short: Estimated annual plastic emission into the ocean
        description_key:
          - This is the modeled amount of mismanaged plastic waste that reaches the ocean via rivers.
          - It equals MPW × P(E), where P(E) is the emission probability.

      me_tons_per_year_per_capita:
        title: Plastic emitted into ocean per capita
        unit: kilograms per person
        short_unit: kg
        description_short: Annual plastic emission into the ocean per person
        processing_level: major
        description_key:
          - This is the per capita amount of plastic waste that reaches the ocean via rivers.
          - Calculated by dividing total plastic emissions by population.

      me_tons_per_year_share_of_global:
        title: Share of global plastic emissions
        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
        description_short: Country's share of total global plastic emissions into ocean
        processing_level: major
        description_key:
          - This shows what percentage of global riverine plastic emissions comes from this country.
          - Calculated as the country's emissions divided by the sum of all countries' emissions.

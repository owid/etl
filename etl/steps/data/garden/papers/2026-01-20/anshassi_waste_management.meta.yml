  text_msw_definition: &text_msw_definition
    Municipal solid waste is everyday, non-hazardous waste from households and similar municipal sources (for example, shops, offices, and institutions).

  text_percent_of_generation: &text_percent_of_generation
    This is expressed as a share of all waste generated in a country (by mass), not just the portion that was collected.

  text_collection_definition: &text_collection_definition
    Collected waste is waste that is picked up by organized collection services (such as public, private, or contracted waste collectors) and enters a managed waste system. This is true regardless of how the waste is ultimately disposed of or treated.

  text_uncollected_definition: &text_uncollected_definition
    Uncollected waste is waste that is not picked up by organized collection services and therefore remains outside the formal waste management system. This waste is often dumped, burned, or handled informally by individuals or communities.

  text_open_dump_definition: &text_open_dump_definition
    Open dumps are uncontrolled disposal sites with little or no infrastructure to safely contain waste. For example, they typically have minimal covering of waste, no systems to manage contaminated water (leachate), and no systems to manage landfill gas emissions.

  text_controlled_landfill_definition: &text_controlled_landfill_definition
    Controlled landfills have some basic operational and pollution controls (such as some covering of waste and site management), but have less advanced infrastructure than sanitary landfills.

  text_sanitary_landfill_definition: &text_sanitary_landfill_definition
    Sanitary landfills are engineered disposal sites with advanced infrastructure designed to safely contain waste and prevent pollution. They typically have protective liners to prevent contamination of soil and groundwater, systems to manage contaminated water (leachate), and in many cases systems to capture or control landfill gas emissions.

  text_open_burning_definition: &text_open_burning_definition
    Open-air burning is when waste is burned in open, uncontrolled fires (rather than in purpose-built incineration facilities with pollution controls).

  text_mswi_definition: &text_mswi_definition
    Municipal solid waste incineration is controlled burning of waste in purpose-built incinerators. These facilities typically have emissions controls to reduce air pollution, and some also recover energy from the burning process.

  text_composting_definition: &text_composting_definition
    Composting is a biological process that breaks down organic waste (such as food scraps and garden waste) to produce compost, which can be used to improve soil quality.

  text_recycling_definition: &text_recycling_definition
    Recycling is the process of collecting and reprocessing waste materials (such as paper, plastic, glass, and metals) to create new products.

  text_classification_definition: &text_classification_definition
    Each country is assigned to one of four waste management system levels (1 to 4). Level 1 represents the most advanced systems (with more waste treated via recycling, composting, or incineration, and less waste mismanaged). Level 4 represents the least controlled systems (with less waste treated and more waste ending up in open dumps or burned in the open air).

  text_classification_criteria: &text_classification_criteria
    "Levels are assigned using two indicators and fixed thresholds. The ICR rate is defined as the sum of the shares of waste that are incinerated, composted, or recycled. The mismanagement rate is defined as the share of waste that is openly dumped, burned in the open air, or otherwise handled in an uncontrolled way.

    Countries are classified as follows:
    - Level 1: ICR rate > 60% AND mismanagement rate < 3%.
    - Level 2: ICR rate between 20% and 60% (inclusive) AND mismanagement rate < 3%.
    - Level 3: mismanagement rate between 3% and 80% (inclusive).
    - Level 4: mismanagement rate > 80%."

  text_classification_caution: &text_classification_caution
    This level is a simplified categorization intended for comparing countries globally. Countries within the same level can still differ substantially in how they handle waste.

  text_data_sources: &text_data_sources
    The indicator is based on waste generation and management data from the World Bank’s What a Waste 2.0 database, combined with mismanagement rates from Lebreton and Andrady (2019). The authors used World Bank data from 2016, standardised it, and projected the results to 2020.

  text_gap_filling: &text_gap_filling
    For countries with missing data, the authors used proxy countries with similar characteristics (same region, classification level, and income level) to fill gaps in waste composition and management statistics.

     The year represents the start of the 5-year age-standardised survival estimates by cancer site for 5-year rolling cohorts from 2006-2010 to 2016-2020.

  diag_route: &diag_route |-
    <% if route == "Screening" %>
    Screening is flagged by the cancer registry as detected via the breast, bowel, or cervical screening programmes.
    <% elif route == "USC" %>
    USC (Urgent Suspected Cancer)refers to urgent GP referrals with a suspicion of cancer (previously known as two-week wait/TWW).
    <% elif route == "GP referral" %>
    GP referral includes routine and urgent referrals where the patient was not referred under the USC (Urgent Suspected Cancer) route, meaning the referral was not made with an immediate suspicion of cancer.
    <% elif route == "Emergency presentation" %>
    Emergency presentation is an emergency route via accident and emergency (A&E), emergency GP referral, emergency transfer, emergency admission, or attendance.
    <% elif route == "Other route" %>
    Other route is an elective route starting with an outpatient appointment that is either a self-referral, consultant to consultant referral, other or unknown referral (excludes patients originally referred under the USC referral route).

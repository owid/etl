        title: Age-standardized cervical cancer incidence rate per 100,000 women
        unit: 'per 100,000 women'
        description_short: |-
          Estimated number of new cervical [cancer](#dod:cancer) cases per 100,000 women.
        description_from_producer: |-
          An age-standardized rate (ASR) is a summary measure of the rate that would have been observed if the population had a standard age structure. Standardization is necessary when comparing several populations that differ with respect to age, because age has a strong influence on the risk of cancer. An ASR is a weighted mean of the age-specific rates; the weighting is based on the population distribution of a standard population. The most frequently used standard population is the World (W) Standard Population. The calculated incidence rate is then called the age-standardized incidence or mortality rate (W), and is expressed per 100 000 person-years. The World Standard Population used in GLOBOCAN was first proposed by Segi (1960)a and later modified by Doll et al. (1966)b.

              note: To allow for comparisons between countries and over time, this metric is [age-standardized](#dod:age_standardized). The methods of estimation are country-specific, and the quality of the national estimates depends on the coverage, accuracy, and timeliness of the recorded incidence and mortality data in a given country.

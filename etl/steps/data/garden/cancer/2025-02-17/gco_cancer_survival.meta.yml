        description_key:
          - The percentage of patients still alive at a certain time after diagnosis, assuming cancer is the only cause of death.
          - Net survival estimates survival by removing the effect of other causes of death.
          - It represents the theoretical survival of cancer patients if they could only die from cancer-related causes.
          - This measure allows fair comparisons between groups with different probabilities of non-cancer death.

        description_short: The percentage of patients still alive 5 years after the diagnosis, assuming cancer is the only cause of death.
        description_key:
          - The percentage of patients still alive at a certain time after diagnosis, assuming cancer is the only cause of death.
          - Net survival estimates survival by removing the effect of other causes of death.
          - It represents the theoretical survival of cancer patients if they could only die from cancer-related causes.
          - This measure allows fair comparisons between groups with different probabilities of non-cancer death.
          - Net survival rates that are age-standardized using the International Cancer Survival Standard (ICSS) weights.

        description_short: The probability of developing cancer in a given population in a given year.
        description_key:
          - Cancer incidence is the number of new cancer cases arising in a specified population over a given period of time (typically 1 year).
          - It can be expressed as an absolute number of cases within the entire population per year or as a rate per 100, 000 persons per year.
          - Incidence information is collected routinely by cancer registries.
          - Rates are age-standardized using the World Standard Population.

        description_key:
          - Cancer mortality is the number of deaths due to cancer occurring in a specified population in a given year.
          - It can be expressed as an absolute number of deaths within the entire population per year or as a rate per 100 000 persons per year.
          - Mortality data are provided by national statistical offices.
          - Rates are age-standardized using the World Standard Population.

        description_short: |-
          Electricity prices expressed as levelized cost of energy (LCOE), which includes the cost of building, maintaining, and operating a power plant, as well as ongoing fuel and operational expenses over its lifetime. This data is expressed in US dollars per [megawatt-hour](#dod:watt-hours), adjusted for inflation.

          - Prices have been adjusted for inflation using the U.S. GDP deflator from the World Bank (World Development Indicators, [NY.GDP.DEFL.ZS](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.DEFL.ZS?locations=US)). To convert the original prices in current US$ to constant {BASE_DOLLAR_YEAR} US$, they were divided by the deflator value for {BASE_DOLLAR_YEAR_ORIGINAL} and then multiplied by the deflator value for {BASE_DOLLAR_YEAR}. Where World Bank data was unavailable, missing values were supplemented using the Gross Domestic Product: Implicit Price Deflator from the Federal Reserve Economic Data ([GDPDEF](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDPDEF)).

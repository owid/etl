    - Not all students enroll in school at the same age. This indicator shows how many students are attending a certain level of education, regardless of whether they are considered to be within the expected age range for that level.
    - It captures the total number of students enrolled at a specific education level, expressed as a percentage of the population in the official age group for that level.
    - For example, if upper secondary school is designed for ages 15 to 17, the gross enrolment ratio compares total enrolment at that level to the population of 15- to 17-year-olds.
    - A high value means many people are accessing education at that level, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that they are in the appropriate grade for their age.
    - The gross enrolment ratio includes students who are younger or older than expected due to late entry, early entry, or grade repetition.
    - The data comes from administrative records, such as school enrolment reports, and from population estimates, usually provided by UN or national sources.
    - A gross enrolment ratio close to or above 100% can indicate strong system capacity, but it doesn’t tell us whether every school-age child is enrolled.
    - This indicator is best understood when used together with the net enrolment rate, which focuses on age-appropriate participation.
    - One limitation is that the gross enrolment ratio can exceed 100%, which may require further data to understand the reasons — such as whether students are repeating grades or starting school late.

  desc_literacy: &desc_literacy
    - Literacy unlocks access to education, employment, and civic participation — this indicator shows what share of young people and adults can read and write a short, simple sentence with understanding.
    - It captures the percentage of individuals in a given age group (such as young people aged 15–24 or adults aged 15 and above) who are considered literate, based on their ability to both read and write.
    - The literacy rate is calculated by dividing the number of literate persons by the total number of individuals in the same age group, excluding those with unknown literacy status.
    - A high literacy rate signals that most people have acquired basic reading and writing skills, often through primary education or literacy programs. Low rates may indicate gaps in access, retention, or effectiveness of foundational education.
    - Data typically come from population censuses or household surveys and are often self-reported. In some countries, respondents may be asked to read or write a simple sentence or complete basic tasks to verify literacy.
    - The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) and its partners also use statistical models to estimate literacy rates for years or regions where recent data are not available, supporting regional and global comparisons.
    - For most countries literacy is self-reported but there may be some challenges associated to changes over time in a given country and to differences in definition across countries.
    - Literacy should not be confused with functional literacy. This indicator reflects basic abilities but does not measure whether individuals can apply these skills effectively in daily life, work, or learning.

        description_key:
          - Literacy unlocks access to education, employment, and civic participation — this indicator shows how equally those opportunities are available to boys and girls in their youth.
          - It captures gender equality in basic literacy by comparing literacy rates between young women and young men aged 15–24.
          - The adjusted gender parity index (GPIA) is calculated by dividing the female youth literacy rate by the male youth literacy rate. If the result exceeds 1, it is inverted and subtracted from 2, producing a scale from 0 to 2, with 1 indicating parity.
          - A GPIA value of 1 means young men and women are equally likely to be literate. A value below 1 indicates a gap in favor of males, and a value above 1 suggests a gap in favor of females.
          - Literacy is usually defined as the ability to both read and write a short, simple sentence with understanding. The rate is based on self-reported data or, in some cases, assessed through basic reading or writing tasks.
          - Data sources include national censuses and household surveys. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) and partners may also use modelled estimates when recent or complete data are not available.
          - This indicator measures basic literacy, not functional literacy. It reflects the presence of foundational skills, but not whether they are applied effectively in everyday contexts.
          - Cross-country comparability may be affected by differences in definitions, data collection methods, and the extent to which responses are self-reported or verified.

          - This indicator shows what portion of the adult population (aged 25 and above) has attained at least a post-secondary level of education, including vocational or university-level qualifications.
          - It is calculated by dividing the number of adults who have completed at least post-secondary education by the total population in the same age group, and multiplying by 100.
          - Post-secondary education includes ISCED levels 4 (post-secondary non-tertiary), 5 (short-cycle tertiary), 6 (bachelor's or equivalent), 7 (master's or equivalent), and 8 (doctoral or equivalent).
          - The 25+ age group is used because most people have completed their formal education by this age, making it a reliable population for tracking educational attainment.
          - The data come from national censuses, labour force surveys, or other household surveys, and are usually mapped to the ISCED-11 framework after data collection.
          - There are important limitations to consider. Comparisons across countries may be affected by differences in how qualifications are mapped to ISCED levels, and some educational programmes may not be easily classified.
          - In addition, the indicator reflects only the level of education completed — not the quality of education or whether the person uses their qualification in the labour market.

          - This indicator shows how many pupils are taught, on average, by each qualified teacher at a specific level of education.
          - A qualified teacher is defined as someone who has met the minimum academic and professional requirements to teach at the relevant level in their country, often specific to the subjects they are assigned to.
          - The indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of pupils enrolled at a given level of education by the number of qualified teachers at that same level.
          - A lower ratio generally suggests more individual attention per student and potentially higher teaching quality, while higher ratios may signal teacher shortages or large class sizes.
          - Data are based on headcounts, but where possible, adjustments are made for part-time teachers (converted to full-time equivalents), double-shift teachers (counted twice), and other teaching practices such as multi-grade classrooms.
          - Teachers included are professionals whose main role is to deliver formal curriculum content to students in recognized educational institutions.
          - This indicator is useful for assessing the adequacy of the teaching workforce and for evaluating education quality and equity.
          - However, it should be interpreted with care, as national definitions of “qualified” vary and the ratio may not reflect actual classroom conditions or teaching effectiveness.
          - Other contextual factors, such as school schedules, subject specialization, and administrative responsibilities, may also influence the interpretation of the ratio.

          - Many children who are old enough for primary school are not attending any kind of school — this indicator shows how many are missing out on education.
          - It captures the share of children in the official primary school age range who are not enrolled in primary or secondary education.
          - The indicator is calculated by subtracting the number of enrolled primary-age children (regardless of the level of education) from the total number of children in that age group, and expressing the result as a percentage.
          - These children may have never enrolled, may have dropped out, or may be starting late and not yet entered school.
          - A high out-of-school rate highlights the need for improved access and targeted policies to reach excluded groups. When disaggregated, the indicator helps identify gaps by sex, location, or socioeconomic status.
          - The data comes from administrative records and household surveys that collect information on enrolment by single year of age and compare it with population estimates for the same group.
          - As with all estimates, there are limitations. Differences in data sources, enrolment definitions, and the timing of data collection (especially if late in the school year) can affect accuracy.

        description_key:
          - Governments must make choices about where to invest public funds — this indicator shows how much priority is given to education relative to other sectors.
          - It captures the proportion of total general government spending (including health, social services, and other sectors) that is allocated to education, based on local, regional, and central budgets.
          - The indicator is calculated by dividing total government spending on education (including all levels) by total government spending on all sectors, and expressing the result as a percentage.
          - A higher percentage reflects stronger prioritization of education in public budgeting, while a lower value may indicate limited fiscal space or other spending priorities.
          - The Education 2030 Framework for Action recommends that governments allocate at least 15–20% of their total spending to education.
          - Data come from a combination of national sources — such as finance ministry reports and education budget documents — and international sources like the IMF’s World Economic Outlook for total government spending figures.
          - The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) compiles and validates this data through its Formal Education Survey and Dynamic Template, cross-referencing with IMF data to ensure consistency.
          - While useful for comparing education financing efforts across countries, differences in budget structures, spending classifications, and demographic factors (e.g. age distribution) can affect comparability.
          - Countries with younger populations may naturally allocate more to education, while those with older populations may invest more in healthcare or pensions — these context differences should be considered when interpreting this indicator.

        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
        description_key:
          - This indicator shows how much of a country’s overall economic resources are invested in its education system.
          - It captures government spending on education — both current and capital — as a percentage of national GDP for a given year.
          - The indicator is calculated by dividing total government spending on education by the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and multiplying by 100.
          - A higher value suggests a stronger policy commitment to education and potentially greater availability of funding for schools, teachers, materials, and infrastructure.
          - The Education 2030 Framework for Action recommends allocating at least 4% to 6% of GDP to education as a benchmark for sufficient public investment.
          - Data on education spending are gathered from national finance or education ministries through the annual UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) education survey or the UNESCO-OECD-Eurostat (UOE) collection.
          - GDP data come from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators and are updated quarterly, with the June release typically used for reporting this indicator.
          - Disaggregated values by level of education (e.g. primary, secondary) can reveal how resources are distributed across the system.
          - While useful for comparing education investment across countries, the indicator may underestimate total spending if education budgets from ministries other than the Ministry of Education are not included.
          - Changes in economic output (GDP) can also affect the indicator, so it’s important to interpret trends in the context of both economic and education sector developments.

        description_key:
          - Many adolescents who are old enough for lower secondary school are not enrolled — this indicator shows how many are missing out on education during this critical stage.
          - It captures the share of children in the official lower secondary age range who are not enrolled in any formal education, including pre-primary, primary, secondary, or tertiary levels.
          - The indicator is calculated by subtracting the number of enrolled lower secondary-aged adolescents (regardless of the education level they attend) from the total population in that age group, and expressing the result as a percentage.
          - These adolescents may have never made the transition from primary school, may have dropped out early, or may be late entrants who haven’t yet re-entered the system.
          - A high out-of-school rate signals the need for better policies and programmes that promote continued schooling through early adolescence, particularly in underserved communities.
          - The data is drawn from a combination of administrative records on school enrolment by age and household surveys that track participation in education, compared with population estimates for the relevant age group.
          - As with all education indicators, results should be interpreted with caution — differences in data sources, how enrolment is defined, and the timing of surveys (especially if conducted late in the school year) may affect the accuracy of estimates.

          - Trained teachers are essential for delivering quality education — this indicator shows what share of secondary school teachers have the minimum required qualifications.
          - It captures the percentage of lower and upper secondary teachers who have received at least the minimum organized pedagogical training, either pre-service or in-service, required to teach at their level according to national standards.
          - The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of trained teachers in secondary education by the total number of teachers at that level, and multiplying the result by 100.
          - A high value indicates that most students in secondary education are being taught by teachers who are considered pedagogically qualified to teach at that level.
          - The data comes from administrative records collected at the school or national level and typically includes information on teacher training credentials and employment status.
          - This indicator is disaggregated by sex and level of education (lower and upper secondary), allowing for a closer look at training disparities across groups.
          - Limitations arise from the fact that national standards for minimum teacher qualifications vary widely, making it difficult to compare levels of training across countries.
          - Additionally, in many countries, data may not distinguish between subject-specific training and general pedagogical training, which can affect how meaningful the figures are for judging teacher preparedness.

        description_key:
          - Safe drinking water is essential for a healthy learning environment — this indicator shows how many primary schools provide students with access to clean water.
          - It measures the percentage of primary schools that have access to basic drinking water services, meaning water from an improved source that is available on school grounds or within a short walking distance.
          - Improved sources include piped water, boreholes, protected wells or springs, rainwater, or packaged/tank water that meets national safety standards.
          - A high value reflects adequate infrastructure for supporting health, hygiene, and student well-being, which are essential for school participation and performance.
          - The data is typically collected through school censuses or education management information systems (EMIS) and is reported by school administrators or district education offices.
          - This indicator can be disaggregated by location (urban/rural), public/private management, or region to identify equity gaps in access to basic services across schools.
          - In some contexts, data may rely on school-reported access, without verifying water quality or availability throughout the year.
          - While access alone does not guarantee regular availability or safety, this measure is a key starting point for understanding school readiness to support children’s health and learning needs.

        description_key:
          - Access to separate toilets for girls and boys is essential for dignity, privacy, and hygiene — this indicator shows how many primary schools provide this basic facility.
          - It measures the proportion of primary schools with basic sanitation facilities that are single-sex, meaning there are separate, usable toilets for male and female students on site.
          - Basic sanitation facilities include functional and private toilets that hygienically separate human waste from human contact and are not shared with other buildings or the public.
          - A high percentage indicates better readiness of the school system to provide a safe and inclusive learning environment, especially for girls, who may be more likely to miss school without such facilities.
          - The data is typically collected through national school censuses or Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) and is reported by school officials.
          - Disaggregating this indicator by urban/rural location, region, or public/private management can help identify disparities in access to gender-sensitive school infrastructure.
          - Some limitations include potential discrepancies in how countries define or report "usable" or "functional" toilets, and whether cleanliness, maintenance, or disability access are accounted for.

        short_unit: "$"
        description_key:
          - This indicator shows how much governments are investing, on average, in each primary school student.
          - It captures total general (local, regional, and central) government spending on [primary education](#dod:primary-education) — including current and capital spending and transfers paid (such as scholarships) — but excludes international transfers received by the government.
          - To reflect purchasing power across countries and allow comparisons over time, the amount is expressed in constant international dollars, which adjust for price level differences and inflation.
          - The value is calculated by subtracting any international transfers to government from total government spending on primary education, and dividing by the total number of students enrolled at the primary level.
          - A higher value indicates greater government investment per child in primary school, which can support better infrastructure, teaching, and learning outcomes.
          - The data comes from administrative financial records, including national education accounts, and are reported to international bodies like the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS).
          - It’s important to note that in some cases, spending data may only include spending from the Ministry of Education and exclude spending by other government bodies. Where international transfers cannot be separately identified, they may remain included, leading to slight overestimation.

          - It captures the percentage of the population aged 3 to 5 years above the official age for the last grade of primary school who are estimated to have successfully completed that level.
          - Completion age is based on the expected school trajectory — if children start school on time and progress without repeating. For example, if primary starts at age 6 and lasts six years, completion is assessed among 14- to 16-year-olds.
          - These estimates are produced using a statistical model that draws from administrative and survey data, filling gaps where direct observations are missing or inconsistent.
          - A high rate means that most children eventually reach the final grade of primary school, with some allowance for delays. Lower rates may signal barriers to school entry, dropout, or grade repetition.
          - The data sources include household surveys, censuses, and administrative records, with modelled adjustments to improve comparability across countries.
          - Because values are estimated, they may differ from official national figures. Differences in school systems or grade structures can also affect comparability.

        description_key:
          - Many children never make it to the final grade of their school level — this indicator shows how close boys and girls are to completing primary education by a slightly older age than expected.
          - It captures gender equality in completion rates for [primary education](#dod:primary-education) by comparing the percentage of girls and boys, aged 3 to 5 years older than the official age for the last grade of primary school, who have successfully completed that level.
          - The completion age group is based on the expected school path — if children start school on time and progress without repeating or skipping grades. For example, if primary starts at age 6 and lasts 6 years, completion is measured among 14–16-year-olds.
          - The adjusted gender parity index (GPIA) is calculated by dividing the female completion rate by the male completion rate. If the result exceeds 1, it is inverted and subtracted from 2. The index ranges from 0 to 2, with 1 indicating exact parity.
          - A value of 1 means girls and boys complete primary education at equal rates. Values below 1 suggest an advantage for boys; values above 1 suggest an advantage for girls.
          - A high completion rate — close to 100% — means nearly all children complete primary school by the benchmark age, allowing for delays. Lower rates may point to late school entry, dropouts, repetition, or other barriers to completion.
          - The data comes primarily from household surveys and population censuses that collect information about each individual’s highest completed grade and age. This is combined with official data on school starting ages and duration.
          - Limitations include inconsistencies in how countries map completed grades to international standards (ISCED), changes in school structure over time, and the risk of underestimating completion when programme durations differ in practice from official definitions.

  desc_key_govt_expenditure_constant_ppp_per_student: &desc_key_govt_expenditure_constant_ppp_per_student
   - This indicator shows how much a government spends per student at a particular level of education, expressed in constant international dollars.
   - It’s calculated by dividing total government spending by the number of enrolled students, and adjusted for inflation and differences in purchasing power between countries. This makes it possible to compare investment levels across education systems and over time.
   - It includes all forms of public education spending — from teacher salaries and textbooks to school maintenance, capital projects like building classrooms, and external funding from international donors that flows through government budgets.
   - Figures are initially reported in local currency, then converted using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates and adjusted to a constant base year. This ensures the numbers reflect real resource commitments rather than changes in local prices or currency fluctuations. For example, data released in 2017 would typically be expressed in 2014 dollars.
   - Higher values suggest that more resources are available per student — which could support better infrastructure, teaching quality, and learning environments. But it doesn’t tell us how effectively the money is used, or whether outcomes are improving.
   - This is one of the most useful measures for understanding how governments fund education relative to the size of their student population. It’s especially helpful when comparing countries with different overall budgets or economic conditions.

  desc_key_govt_expenditure_gdp_share: &desc_key_govt_expenditure_gdp_share
   - This indicator shows the share of a country’s economic output (GDP) that is spent on education. It reflects how much of the national budget is directed toward education relative to the size of the economy.
   - It includes all government spending at the relevant education level — from central, regional, and local authorities — and covers both current and capital expenditures.
   - A higher percentage means a larger share of national resources is allocated to education, which may indicate political commitment or policy prioritization. But it doesn’t necessarily mean higher spending per student or better outcomes. Countries with lower GDPs might have high percentages but limited resources in absolute terms.
   - This indicator is useful for understanding how education fits within the broader picture of government spending and national development. It should be interpreted alongside measures like per-student spending and enrolment rates.

  # Enrollment and attendance descriptions
  desc_key_ger: &desc_key_ger
    - The gross enrolment ratio counts all students enrolled at a specific education level, regardless of their age. This includes students who are younger or older than the official age range because they started school early, started late, or repeated grades.
    - It measures the total number of students of any age enrolled at an education level as a percentage of the population in the official age group for that level. For example, if primary school is designed for ages 6-11, the gross enrolment ratio compares total primary enrolment (all ages) to the population of 6- to 11-year-olds.
    - Values can exceed 100% when students repeat grades or start late. For instance, primary school enrolment might include 12- or 13-year-olds who started late or repeated grades, pushing the ratio above 100%.
    - A value of 100% does not guarantee that all children in the official age group are enrolled in school; some may be out of school entirely, but the ratio appears high due to older students being counted in the total.
    - Values much lower than 100% indicate that many children of the official age are not enrolled at the expected education level - they may be out of school entirely, enrolled at a different level, or have never started school.
    - Values much higher than 100% can indicate educational challenges such as high grade repetition rates, late school entry, or inefficient progression through the system.
    - The data comes from administrative records such as school enrolment reports, combined with population estimates typically sourced from the United Nations or national statistical offices.

  desc_key_net_enr: &desc_key_net_enr
    - The net enrolment rate shows what percentage of children are enrolled at the education level intended for their age.
    - It compares children enrolled at the correct level for their age to the total population in that same age group. For example, a primary school net enrolment of 90% means 90% of children between the ages of 6 and 11 years are enrolled in primary school. Children who are not enrolled in school or are enrolled at another education level (pre-primary school) are not counted here.
    - The highest possible value is 100%, which would mean all children of the right age are enrolled where they should be. High rates indicate that most children are progressing through school at the expected pace.
    - A rate of 90% doesn't necessarily mean 10% of children are out of school entirely — some may be enrolled at different levels (either higher or lower) than expected for their age, but these students aren't counted in the net rate.
    - The data comes from school administrative records that track enrolment by individual age, combined with population estimates from national statistics offices or UN sources.

  desc_literacy: &desc_literacy
    - Literacy is a foundational skill. Children need to learn to read so that they can read to learn. When we fail to teach this foundational skill, people have fewer opportunities to lead the rich and interesting lives that a good education offers.
    - This indicator measures the percentage of people who can read and write a simple sentence about their daily life. It’s calculated as the number of people in a given age group who report being able to do so, divided by the total number in that group. UNESCO tracks this across different generations – including youth, adults, and older people – to show how literacy is changing over time.
    - Most of the data comes from national surveys. In some countries, people are asked directly whether they can read and write; in others, they take a short test.
    - In many high–income countries, literacy rates reached near–universal levels by the late 20th century. As a result, regular tracking has been scaled back, since changes are small and less relevant for education policy.
    - This data tells us whether someone can read and write at a very basic level – for example, reading simple sentences or writing their name. But it doesn’t tell us whether they can use reading and writing in everyday life, like filling out a job application or reading health instructions. Those kinds of skills take more years of schooling and are much harder to measure, especially when comparing across countries and over time.

  desc_key_completion_rate: &desc_key_completion_rate
    - This indicator estimates the share of children who complete a given level of education, even if they do so later than the expected age.
    - For example, if the official age of completion for primary school is 11 years old, a child who completes it at 14 years old would still be included. This is to account for the fact that some children may start school late, or have to repeat years.
    - The data sources include household surveys, censuses, and administrative records, with modelled adjustments to improve comparability across countries.
    - These estimates are produced using a statistical model that draws on these sources, filling gaps where direct observations are missing or inconsistent.
    - Because values are estimated, they may differ from official national figures. Differences in school systems or grade structures can also affect comparability.

  description_key_out_school: &description_key_out_school
    - Many children and adolescents around the world are not in school, even though they are old enough to be. This indicator shows how many are missing out on education at each stage of the system.
    - It measures the share of individuals in the official age range for a given level of education who are not enrolled at that level of education.
    - These children or adolescents may have never entered school, may have dropped out, or may be starting later than expected.
    - A share of 10% for children out of primary school means that 90% of all 6- to 11-year-olds are enrolled in primary education.
    - High out-of-school rates signal barriers to access — such as poverty, gender inequality, location, or limited availability of schools — and highlight where more targeted support is needed.
    - The data comes from administrative school enrolment records and household surveys, which provide age-specific insights when compared to population estimates.
    - As with all education data, results should be interpreted carefully. Differences in how enrolment is defined, inconsistencies in age reporting, and timing of data collection (such as during holidays or late in the school year) can affect accuracy.

  desc_key_prof: &desc_key_prof
    - This indicator measures the share of children or students who achieve minimum proficiency in reading or mathematics by the end of a given education level (primary or lower secondary).
    - "Minimum proficiency in [reading](#dod:reading-proficiency) and [mathematics](#dod:math-proficiency) is defined differently at each education level."
    - "At the end of **[primary education](#dod:primary-education)**, minimum reading proficiency means students can identify key ideas in simple texts and connect them to their own experiences. In mathematics, it means demonstrating number sense and computation, basic measurement, interpreting simple graphs, spatial orientation, and number patterns."
    - "At the end of **[lower secondary](#dod:lower-secondary-education)**, minimum reading proficiency means students can connect ideas across different types of texts, understand the author’s intent, and draw conclusions based on the text. In mathematics, it means applying computation skills, solving real-world problems, interpreting graphs and tables, and using algebraic representations."
    - "There are two types of estimates: one for all children in the age group, and one for students who are enrolled in school."
    - Estimates for all children adjust for school completion and enrolment, offering a full population-level view — including those who dropped out or were never enrolled.
    - Estimates for students reflect outcomes only among those still in school at the end of the education cycle.
    - Data comes from international assessments such as [TIMSS, PIRLS](https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/), or [PISA](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/programmes/pisa.html), combined with completion and enrolment data from surveys or statistical models.

  desc_key_qualified_teachers: &desc_key_qualified_teachers
    - Not all teachers have the same level of academic preparation in the subjects they teach. This indicator measures the percentage of teachers at each education level who have at least the minimum academic qualifications required for teaching their subjects at that level in their country.
    - It captures the share of teachers who are academically qualified, expressed as a percentage of all teachers at that level. For example, if there are 1,000 secondary teachers and 900 have the required academic qualifications, the indicator shows 90%.
    - The "minimum academic qualifications" refers to whatever subject-matter credentials each country requires - university degrees in relevant fields, subject-specific certifications, or other requirements that demonstrate mastery of the content being taught. This focuses on subject knowledge rather than pedagogical training (how to teach).
    - Values below 100% suggest some teachers are teaching subjects without the academic qualifications their own country deems necessary. However, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution since requirements vary significantly between nations.
    - The data comes from administrative records collected at schools and other organized learning centers, typically including information on teacher academic credentials and employment status.

        description_short: An [adjusted gender parity index](#dod:adjusted-gpi) of 1 indicates equal basic literacy rates among young men and women aged 15–24. Values below 1 favor young men, and above 1 favor young women.
        unit: "index"
        description_key:
          - Literacy unlocks access to education, employment, and civic participation — this indicator shows how equally those opportunities are available to boys and girls in their youth.
          - It captures gender equality in basic literacy by comparing literacy rates between young women and young men aged 15–24.
          - The adjusted gender parity index (GPIA) is calculated by dividing the female youth literacy rate by the male youth literacy rate. If the result exceeds 1, it is inverted and subtracted from 2, producing a scale from 0 to 2, with 1 indicating parity.
          - A GPIA value of 1 means young men and women are equally likely to be literate. A value below 1 indicates a gap in favor of males, and a value above 1 suggests a gap in favor of females.
          - Literacy is usually defined as the ability to both read and write a short, simple sentence with understanding. The rate is based on self-reported data or, in some cases, assessed through basic reading or writing tasks.
          - Data sources include national censuses and household surveys. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) and partners may also use modelled estimates when recent or complete data are not available.
          - This indicator measures basic literacy, not functional literacy. It reflects the presence of foundational skills, but not whether they are applied effectively in everyday contexts.
          - Cross-country comparability may be affected by differences in definitions, data collection methods, and the extent to which responses are self-reported or verified.

          - This indicator shows the share of adults (aged 25 and older) who have attained at least a post-secondary level of education, including vocational or university-level qualifications.
          - It is calculated by dividing the number of adults who have completed post-secondary or tertiary education by the total adult population in the same age group, then multiplying by 100.
          - This includes vocational training, college diplomas, associate degrees, bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and doctoral degrees. Examples include nursing diplomas, engineering degrees, business administration degrees, and PhDs.
          - The 25+ age group is chosen because most people have completed formal education by this stage, making it a stable reference for educational attainment.
          - Data sources include national censuses, labour force surveys, and household surveys, typically harmonized after collection.
          - There are limitations to cross-country comparisons due to differences in how qualifications are defined and classified.
          - The indicator captures only the highest level of education completed. It does not reflect the quality of education or whether qualifications are actively used in the labour market.

          - This indicator shows what portion of the adult population (aged 25 and above) has attained at least a lower secondary level of education.
          - It is calculated by dividing the number of adults who have completed at least lower secondary education by the total population in the same age group, and multiplying by 100.
          - Lower secondary education typically corresponds to ages 12 to 15 or 16.
          - The 25+ age group is used because most people have completed their formal education by this age, making it a reliable population for tracking educational attainment.
          - The data come from national censuses, labour force surveys, or other household surveys, and are usually mapped to the [International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)](https://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/international-standard-classification-education-isced) after data collection.
          - There are important limitations to consider. Comparisons across countries may be affected by differences in how qualifications are mapped to ISCED levels, and some educational programmes may not be easily classified.
          - In addition, the indicator reflects only the level of education completed — not the quality of education or whether the person uses their qualification in the labour market.

          - This indicator shows how many pupils are taught, on average, by each qualified teacher at a specific level of education.
          - A qualified teacher is defined as someone who has met the minimum academic and professional requirements to teach at the relevant level in their country, often specific to the subjects they are assigned to.
          - The indicator is calculated by dividing the total number of pupils enrolled at a given level of education by the number of qualified teachers at that same level.
          - A lower ratio generally suggests more individual attention per student and potentially higher teaching quality, while higher ratios may signal teacher shortages or large class sizes.
          - Data are based on headcounts, but where possible, adjustments are made for part-time teachers (converted to full-time equivalents), double-shift teachers (counted twice), and other teaching practices such as multi-grade classrooms.
          - Teachers included are professionals whose main role is to deliver formal curriculum content to students in recognized educational institutions.
          - This indicator is useful for assessing the adequacy of the teaching workforce and for evaluating education quality and equity.
          - However, it should be interpreted with care, as national definitions of “qualified” vary and the ratio may not reflect actual classroom conditions or teaching effectiveness.
          - Other contextual factors, such as school schedules, subject specialization, and administrative responsibilities, may also influence the interpretation of the ratio.

          - Trained teachers are essential for delivering quality education — this indicator shows what share of secondary school teachers have the minimum required qualifications.
          - It captures the percentage of lower and upper secondary teachers who have received at least the minimum organized pedagogical training, either pre-service or in-service, required to teach at their level according to national standards.
          - The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of trained teachers in secondary education by the total number of teachers at that level, and multiplying the result by 100.
          - A high value indicates that most students in secondary education are being taught by teachers who are considered pedagogically qualified to teach at that level.
          - The data comes from administrative records collected at the school or national level and typically includes information on teacher training credentials and employment status.
          - This indicator is disaggregated by sex and level of education (lower and upper secondary), allowing for a closer look at training disparities across groups.
          - Limitations arise from the fact that national standards for minimum teacher qualifications vary widely, making it difficult to compare levels of training across countries.
          - Additionally, in many countries, data may not distinguish between subject-specific training and general pedagogical training, which can affect how meaningful the figures are for judging teacher preparedness.

        description_key:
          - Safe drinking water is essential for a healthy learning environment — this indicator shows how many primary schools provide students with access to clean water.
          - It measures the percentage of primary schools that have access to basic drinking water services, meaning water from an improved source that is available on school grounds or within a short walking distance.
          - Improved sources include piped water, boreholes, protected wells or springs, rainwater, or packaged/tank water that meets national safety standards.
          - A high value reflects adequate infrastructure for supporting health, hygiene, and student well-being, which are essential for school participation and performance.
          - The data is typically collected through school censuses or education management information systems (EMIS) and is reported by school administrators or district education offices.
          - This indicator can be disaggregated by location (urban/rural), public/private management, or region to identify equity gaps in access to basic services across schools.
          - In some contexts, data may rely on school-reported access, without verifying water quality or availability throughout the year.
          - While access alone does not guarantee regular availability or safety, this measure is a key starting point for understanding school readiness to support children’s health and learning needs.

          - Basic sanitation facilities include functional and private toilets that hygienically separate human waste from human contact and are not shared with other buildings or the public.
          - A high percentage indicates better readiness of the school system to provide a safe and inclusive learning environment, especially for girls, who may be more likely to miss school without such facilities.
          - The data is typically collected through national school censuses or Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) and is reported by school officials.
          - Disaggregating this indicator by urban/rural location, region, or public/private management can help identify disparities in access to gender-sensitive school infrastructure.
          - Some limitations include potential discrepancies in how countries define or report "usable" or "functional" toilets, and whether cleanliness, maintenance, or disability access are accounted for.

        description_short: An [adjusted gender parity index](#dod:adjusted-gpi) of 1 indicates equal primary school completion rates between boys and girls. Values below 1 favor boys, and values above 1 favor girls.
        unit: "index"
        description_key:
          - Many children never make it to the final grade of their school level — this indicator shows how close boys and girls are to completing primary education by a slightly older age than expected.
          - It captures gender equality in completion rates for [primary education](#dod:primary-education) by comparing the percentage of girls and boys, aged 3 to 5 years older than the official age for the last grade of primary school, who have successfully completed that level.
          - The completion age group is based on the expected school path — if children start school on time and progress without repeating or skipping grades. For example, if primary starts at age 6 and lasts 6 years, completion is measured among 14–16-year-olds.
          - The adjusted gender parity index (GPIA) is calculated by dividing the female completion rate by the male completion rate. If the result exceeds 1, it is inverted and subtracted from 2. The index ranges from 0 to 2, with 1 indicating exact parity.
          - A value of 1 means girls and boys complete primary education at equal rates. Values below 1 suggest an advantage for boys; values above 1 suggest an advantage for girls.
          - A high completion rate — close to 100% — means nearly all children complete primary school by the benchmark age, allowing for delays. Lower rates may point to late school entry, dropouts, repetition, or other barriers to completion.
          - The data comes from national censuses, labour force surveys, or other household surveys, and are usually mapped to the [International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)](https://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/international-standard-classification-education-isced) levels after data collection. This is combined with official data on school starting ages and duration.
          - There are important limitations to consider. Comparisons across countries may be affected by differences in how qualifications are mapped to ISCED levels, changes in school structure over time, and the risk of underestimating completion when programme durations differ in practice from official definitions.

          - A high completion rate — close to 100% — indicates that nearly all children complete lower secondary school by the benchmark age, accounting for delays. Lower rates may reflect late school entry, dropout, repetition, or systemic barriers to completion.
          - The data are derived from national censuses, labour force surveys, or other household surveys, often mapped to the [International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)](https://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/international-standard-classification-education-isced) levels post-collection.

        description_key:
          - This indicator shows how much of a government’s overall budget is allocated to education. It reflects the priority given to education relative to other sectors such as health, infrastructure, defence, or social protection.
          - It is calculated by dividing total government expenditure on education (across all education levels) by total general government expenditure, and expressing the result as a percentage. The spending figures include budgets from central, regional, and local authorities, where available.
          - A higher percentage suggests that education is a higher fiscal priority within national budgets. Lower values may reflect limited resources, competing demands from other sectors, or different demographic and policy contexts.
          - While this indicator enables useful cross-country comparisons, results should be interpreted with caution. National budget structures, spending classifications, and demographic differences can all affect the comparability of figures. For example, countries with younger populations may naturally devote more resources to education, while ageing populations may drive higher spending on healthcare or pensions.

          **Historical expenditure data:**

          Historical data in this dataset is based on a wide array of sources, reflecting a comprehensive approach to data collection across different time periods and regions. However, the diverse nature of these sources leads to inconsistencies, as methodologies and data quality vary between sources. For instance, older sources like the League of Nations Statistical Yearbook or Mitchell's 1962 data may use different metrics or collection methods compared to more modern sources like the OECD Education reports or UN surveys. This variance in source material and methodology means that direct comparisons across different years or countries might be challenging, necessitating careful interpretation and cross-reference for accuracy. The dataset serves as a rich historical repository but also underscores the complexities and challenges inherent in compiling and harmonizing historical data from multiple, diverse sources.

          **Recent estimates:**

          General government expenditure on education (current, capital, and transfers) is expressed as a percentage of GDP. It includes expenditure funded by transfers from international sources to government. General government usually refers to local, regional and central governments.

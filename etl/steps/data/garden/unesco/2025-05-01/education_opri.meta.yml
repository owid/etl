  desc_key_net_enr: &desc_key_net_enr
    - Not all children of the right age are enrolled in the level of education intended for them— the *net enrolment rate* indicator shows how many are.
    - It captures the percentage of children in the official age group for a specific education level who are enrolled at that same level, such as primary or lower secondary.
    - The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of students of the correct age enrolled in that level by the total number of children in that age group.
    - For example, if primary education starts at age 7 and lasts six years, the official primary school age range would be 7 to 12 years.
    - A high *net enrolment rate* means that most children are enrolled where they are expected to be. The highest possible value is 100%.
    - The data comes from school administrative records, which track enrolment by single year of age, and from population estimates provided by national statistics offices or UN sources.
    - This indicator is especially useful for monitoring progress toward universal primary and secondary education.
    - However, it does not account for children who are enrolled in the correct level but are too young or too old, and it may miss students enrolled in the “wrong” grade for their age.
    - Differences between enrolment and population data can lead to small errors. In some cases, the *net enrolment rate* may slightly exceed 100%.
    - It's also not applied to tertiary education because of the wide range of entry ages and programme lengths at that level.

  desc_key_mye: &desc_key_mye
    - Adults around the world have spent different amounts of time in school—this indicator shows the average number of years completed by people aged 25 and older.
    - It reflects the total years of formal education that adults have successfully finished, excluding any years they may have repeated.
    - The data comes from censuses and household surveys, where adults report the highest level of education they completed. These levels are then matched to standard durations using the ISCED framework.
    - This is a valuable indicator for understanding long-term trends in educational attainment and gender equality.
    - However, it only measures how long people stayed in school—not what they learned or whether they received a quality education.
    - Cross-country comparisons can be challenging. Education systems differ in how long programmes last, and qualifications may not be classified in the same way.

  desc_key_ger: &desc_key_ger
    - Not all students enroll in school at the same age. This indicator shows how many students are attending a certain level of education, regardless of whether they are considered to be within the expected age range for that level.
    - It captures the total number of students enrolled at a specific education level, expressed as a percentage of the population in the official age group for that level.
    - For example, if upper secondary school is designed for ages 15 to 17, the *gross enrolment ratio* compares total enrolment at that level to the population of 15- to 17-year-olds.
    - A high value means many people are accessing education at that level, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that they are in the appropriate grade for their age.
    - The *gross enrolment ratio* includes students who are younger or older than expected due to late entry, early entry, or grade repetition.
    - The data comes from administrative records, such as school enrolment reports, and from population estimates, usually provided by UN or national sources.
    - A *gross enrolment ratio* close to or above 100% can indicate strong system capacity, but it doesn’t tell us whether every school-age child is enrolled.
    - This indicator is best understood when used together with the *net enrolment rate*, which focuses on age-appropriate participation.
    - One limitation is that the *gross enrolment ratio* can exceed 100%, which may require further data to understand the reasons—such as whether students are repeating grades or starting school late.

  desc_key_prim_out_school: &desc_key_prim_out_school
    - This indicator shows the share of children who are the right age for primary school but are not enrolled in primary or secondary education.
    - It focuses on those in the official primary age range—typically 6 to 11 years old—who are not attending any formal level of education.
    - Some may have never entered school, others may have dropped out, or they may not yet have started due to delayed entry.
    - Children who are the right age for primary but are already in secondary school are considered enrolled and are not counted as out of school.
    - The indicator is calculated by subtracting the number of primary-age children enrolled in primary or secondary education from the total in that age group.
    - Data sources include enrolment records from school systems and household surveys that help identify children not captured in administrative data.
    - Estimates may be affected by inconsistencies between sources, late school entry, or surveys conducted at different times of year.
    - Children who are enrolled but not attending regularly may not always be captured correctly, depending on how data is collected and defined.

  deck_key_low_out_school: &deck_key_low_out_school
    - This indicator shows the share of adolescents who are the right age for lower secondary school but are not enrolled at that level.
    - It focuses specifically on those within the official lower secondary age range—usually 12 to 14 or 13 to 15—who are not attending lower secondary education.
    - These adolescents may still be in primary school, may have dropped out, or may not be enrolled at any level.
    - The value is calculated by comparing the number of lower secondary-age children enrolled in lower secondary education to the total number of children in that age group.
    - Data comes from administrative enrolment records and household surveys, which allow tracking by age and education level.
    - Estimates may be affected by mismatches between population and enrolment data, late school entry, or misreporting of enrolment levels.
    - Children enrolled in a different level than expected for their age are included in this indicator, even if they are technically still in school.

  desc_key_up_out_school: &desc_key_up_out_school
  - This indicator shows the share of young people who are the right age for upper secondary school but are not enrolled at that level.
  - It focuses on those within the official upper secondary age range—typically 15 to 17 or 16 to 18—who are not attending upper secondary education.
  - These youth may still be in lower levels of school, may have left school entirely, or may not have transitioned to upper secondary after completing lower secondary.
  - The value is calculated by subtracting the number of upper secondary-age students enrolled at the upper secondary level from the total number in that age group.
  - Data is drawn from school records and household surveys that match enrolment levels to student age.
  - Inconsistencies in definitions of enrolment, age reporting, or school level classifications may affect the estimates.
  - Youth who are in school but enrolled below their age-appropriate level are included in this indicator.

  desc_key_private_enrolment: &desc_key_private_enrolment
    - In many countries, education is provided not only by the government but also by private institutions—this indicator shows how much of total enrolment is taking place in privately run schools or educational programmes.
    - It captures the share of students enrolled in private institutions at a given level of education as a percentage of all students enrolled at that level, including both public and private schools.
    - The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of students in private institutions by the total number of students enrolled at the same education level, then multiplying by 100.
    - A high percentage means that non-governmental providers—such as private individuals, companies, religious bodies, or community organizations—play a significant role in delivering education at that level.
    - The data comes from school censuses and other administrative records that report enrolment numbers by type of institution and education level.
    - This indicator is often disaggregated by level of education and by sex, allowing for analysis of how the role of private education differs across schooling stages and between boys and girls.
    - There are some important limitations. In some countries, the distinction between public and private institutions is blurred—especially where private schools receive government subsidies or public funds are used to support student enrolment through scholarships.
    - Additionally, some private schools may operate without formal registration or may not follow national curricula, which can lead to underreporting and incomplete data in official statistics.
    - Despite these challenges, this indicator helps assess the scale and role of the private education sector within a national education system and informs discussions about education financing, accessibility, and regulation.

  desc_key_total_net_attendance: &desc_key_total_net_attendance
    - Many children who are the right age for a level of education are not actually attending school—the *total net attendance rate* indicator shows how many are, regardless of what level they attend.
    - It captures the percentage of children in the official age group for a given education level who are attending school, whether at the intended level or any other.
    - The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of children of the official age group who are attending school at any level by the total population of children in that age group.
    - For example, if primary education starts at age 7 and lasts six years, the total net attendance rate would be calculated for children aged 7 to 12.
    - A high *total net attendance rate* means most children of the expected age are participating in school. A low rate signals greater exclusion and highlights where education access needs to be improved.
    - This indicator is the complement to the out-of-school rate. If the attendance rate is low, the equivalent out-of-school rate is high.
    - Data for this indicator comes from household surveys and population censuses, which record attendance status and age. Accurate reference age is critical to ensure that children are grouped correctly.
    - The indicator can be disaggregated by sex, urban or rural location, and household wealth quintiles to help identify population groups that are being left out.
    - There are important technical considerations. Survey data may be collected months after the academic year starts, so the child’s age at data collection may not match the age at the start of the school year.
    - To address this, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) adjusts age data when possible using birth month and year. If only the age in years is reported and the survey was conducted more than six months after the start of the academic year, one year is subtracted from the recorded age.
    - When survey data is collected within five months of the school year’s start, the recorded age is used as-is.
    - Despite adjustments, differences between survey responses and national education structures may affect comparability. Incomplete data—such as missing age, attendance status, or grade—are excluded from the calculation.
    - Even with these limitations, the *total net attendance rate* is a valuable measure of school participation that complements enrolment data and helps track progress toward universal access to education.

        description_short: An [adjusted gender parity index](#dod:adjusted-gpi) of 1 indicates equal average years of schooling between men and women. Values below 1 favor men, and above 1 favor women.
        unit: "index"
        description_key:
          - In many countries, men and women have spent different amounts of time in school—this indicator shows how close they are to achieving equality in educational attainment.
          - It captures gender equality in *average years of schooling* by comparing how many years of formal education have been completed on average by women and men aged 25 and older.
          - The *adjusted gender parity index (GPIA)* is calculated by dividing the average years of schooling for women by that of men. If the result is greater than 1, it is inverted and subtracted from 2. This creates a scale from 0 to 2, centered around 1.
          - A GPIA value of 1 means men and women have the same average number of completed school years. A value below 1 shows a gap in favour of men, and a value above 1 shows a gap in favour of women.
          - This indicator is useful for highlighting long-term trends in gender inequality in education and assessing the lasting effects of policies aimed at closing the gender gap.
          - The data comes from household surveys or population censuses, where individuals report the highest level of education they have completed. These levels are then converted into years of schooling based on standard durations defined by ISCED.
          - Because this indicator reflects accumulated schooling over time, it shows how gender disparities have developed across generations.
          - Some limitations include differences in education system structures between countries and challenges in mapping survey responses to ISCED levels. The indicator measures duration of schooling, not its quality or outcomes.
          - Even so, the GPIA for *average years of schooling* provides a clear measure of gender equality in education over the life course, and is an important complement to indicators focused on current enrolment or access.

      school_life_expectancy__primary__adjusted_gender_parity_index__gpia:
        title: School life expectancy in primary education
        description_short: An [adjusted gender parity index](#dod:adjusted-gpi) of 1 indicates equality in the expected number of years a child of school entrance age is likely to spend in [primary](#dod:primary-education) school between boys and girls. Values below 1 favor boys, and above 1 favor girls.
        unit: "index"
        description_key:
            - In many countries, boys and girls do not spend the same amount of time in primary school—this indicator shows how close they are to parity in expected school duration at the primary level.
            - It focuses specifically on *school life expectancy* in [primary education](#dod:primary-education), comparing the average number of years girls and boys are expected to spend in primary school based on current age-specific enrolment rates.
            - The *adjusted gender parity index (GPIA)* is calculated by dividing the female school life expectancy in primary education by the male school life expectancy. If the result exceeds 1, it is inverted and subtracted from 2 to produce a symmetrical scale from 0 to 2, with 1 representing perfect parity.
            - A value of 1 means boys and girls are expected to spend the same number of years in primary school. Values below 1 indicate boys are expected to spend more time in school; values above 1 indicate girls are.
            - This indicator assumes current enrolment trends continue over time and includes all children, even those who may never enrol, giving a comprehensive view of participation in primary education.
            - The data comes from administrative sources such as school censuses and registers, as well as population estimates by age, typically provided by national statistical offices or the United Nations Population Division.
            - Disaggregated by sex, this indicator helps identify gender gaps in access to and retention in primary schooling.
            - As with all expectancy-based indicators, it does not reflect actual completion or quality of education and may not account for repetition or part-time attendance, which can vary across contexts.

      outbound_mobility_ratio__all_regions__both_sexes__uis_estimate__pct:
        title: Share of students studying abroad
        description_short: Percentage of a country's [tertiary](#dod:tertiary-education) level students studying abroad as international students. International students are those that move from their home countries for education, identified based on their past education, residence, or distinct immigration regulations.
        unit: "%"
        short_unit: "%"
        description_key:
          - Many students leave their home country to pursue higher education abroad—this indicator shows what share of a country's tertiary students choose to study in another country.
          - It captures the percentage of students from a given country who are enrolled in tertiary education abroad, relative to the total number of students enrolled in tertiary education at home.
          - The outbound mobility ratio is calculated by dividing the number of students from a country who are studying abroad by the total number of students enrolled in tertiary education within that country.
          - A high outbound mobility ratio means a significant portion of students are going abroad for their studies, which may indicate limited domestic capacity or quality concerns in the home country’s tertiary education system.
          - The data comes from international education surveys and administrative records, including national higher education management systems and institutional reports.
          - This indicator can be broken down by sex, ISCED level, and destination region, helping to analyze patterns of international study and gender dynamics in student mobility.
          - There are some important limitations. Not all countries have a system for tracking outbound students, and some receiving countries may not report enrolment figures by country of origin.
          - Definitions of what counts as a “mobile student” can vary, affecting comparability between countries and over time.
          - Despite these challenges, the *outbound mobility ratio* offers valuable insight into global student flows and highlights international dimensions of access, choice, and demand in tertiary education.

        title: Share of students from abroad
        description_short: International students as a share of the country's overall [tertiary](#dod:tertiary-education) enrolment.

        short_unit: "%"
        description_key:
          - Many students cross borders to pursue higher education—this indicator shows how many are choosing a given country as their destination.
          - It captures the percentage of students from other countries who are enrolled in all levels of tertiary education (ISCED 5 to 8) in a given country, relative to total tertiary enrolment in that same country.
          - The inbound mobility rate is calculated by dividing the number of internationally mobile students studying in the country by the total number of students enrolled in tertiary education within that country.
          - A high inbound mobility rate reflects a strong capacity to attract foreign students and signals that the country may be seen as a hub for international higher education.
          - The data comes from administrative records, such as national higher education information systems and surveys, and includes enrolment disaggregated by country of origin, ISCED level, and sex.
          - This indicator is useful for assessing the international openness of a country's higher education system and understanding student flow patterns across borders.
          - There are several limitations to consider. The indicator may not capture students studying at foreign university branches or campuses within the reporting country, which can lead to underestimation.
          - In addition, how countries define and report “mobile students” can vary, making comparisons between countries less straightforward.
          - Despite these challenges, the *inbound mobility rate* provides important insights into a country’s role in global education and its attractiveness as a destination for international students.

      official_entrance_age_to_compulsory_education__years:
        title: Official entrance age to compulsory education
        description_short: The official age for entering compulsory education is based on students starting at the earliest entrance age, studying full-time, and advancing without grade repetition or skipping.
        unit: "years"
        description_key:
        - Children around the world begin formal education at different ages—this indicator shows the age at which students are officially expected to start a given level of education in their country.
        - It assumes that students begin schooling on time, attend full-time, and progress without repeating or skipping any grades.
        - The official entrance age is typically determined by national laws or education policies and usually reflects the most common age of entry, though not always.
        - This indicator is essential for understanding how an education system is structured and is used as a reference point when calculating other key indicators like enrolment rates or school-age population estimates.
        - It helps identify the age-specific demand for education services and supports national planning for staffing, infrastructure, and learning materials at each education level.
        - Data on official entrance age is reported by national ministries of education and compiled by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, following ISCED classifications to ensure international comparability.
        - While this provides a standard benchmark, actual school entry may vary due to parental choices, local policies, or flexibility in school admissions.
        - To fully interpret this indicator, it should be considered alongside the *theoretical duration* of the level of education, which indicates how long students are expected to remain in that level if they follow the system as designed.

      duration_of_compulsory_education__years:
        title: Duration of compulsory education
        description_short: The number of years of compulsory education is based on students starting at the earliest entrance age, studying full-time, and advancing without grade repetition or skipping.
        unit: "years"
        description_key:
          - The *theoretical duration of compulsory education* refers to the number of years that children are legally required to attend school, as defined by national laws or regulations.
          - This indicator helps determine the school-age population by level of education and is a key input for producing education indicators and assessing a country's education supply capacity in relation to demand.
          - The duration is typically calculated based on the official starting and ending ages for compulsory education, assuming students progress through the system without repeating or skipping grades.
          - For example, if compulsory education starts at age 6 and ends at age 15, the theoretical duration would be 9 years.
          - Data on compulsory education duration are collected from national legislation and formal education standards, and are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure international comparability.
          - It's important to note that while legislation may define the duration of compulsory education, actual implementation and enforcement can vary, and some children may not attend school for the full duration.
          - Changes in national education policies, such as extending or reducing the years of compulsory education, can impact this indicator and should be considered when analyzing trends over time.
          - This indicator is useful for understanding government commitment to education and for planning resource allocation, but it should be interpreted alongside other indicators like enrolment rates and completion rates for a comprehensive view.
          - Limitations include potential discrepancies between legal provisions and actual practice, and differences in how countries define and implement compulsory education.

      theoretical_duration_of_pre_primary_education__years:
        title: Theoretical duration of pre-primary education
        description_short: The average number of years that a child is expected to spend in [pre-primary](#dod:pre-primary-education) education, defined by country's official educational regulations or laws.
        unit: "years"

          - The *theoretical duration of pre-primary education* refers to the number of years that children are expected to attend pre-primary education, as defined by national laws or regulations.
          - This indicator helps determine the school-age population by level of education and is a key input for producing education indicators and assessing a country's education supply capacity in relation to demand.
          - The duration is typically calculated based on the official starting and ending ages for pre-primary education, assuming students progress through the system without repeating or skipping grades.
          - For example, if pre-primary education starts at age 3 and ends at age 6, the theoretical duration would be 3 years.
          - Data on pre-primary education duration are collected from national legislation and formal education standards, and are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure international comparability.
          - It's important to note that while legislation may define the duration of pre-primary education, actual implementation and enforcement can vary, and some children may not attend school for the full duration.
          - Changes in national education policies, such as extending or reducing the years of pre-primary education, can impact this indicator and should be considered when analyzing trends over time.
          - This indicator is useful for understanding government commitment to early childhood education and for planning resource allocation, but it should be interpreted alongside other indicators like enrolment rates and completion rates for a comprehensive view.
          - Limitations include potential discrepancies between legal provisions and actual practice, and differences in how countries define and implement pre-primary education.

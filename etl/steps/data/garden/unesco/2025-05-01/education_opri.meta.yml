  description_processing_per_student: &description_processing_per_student
    This indicator was calculated by dividing the total government expenditure on education at a specific level by the number of students enrolled at that level.
  # Government expenditure descriptions
  desc_key_govt_expenditure_constant_ppp: &desc_key_govt_expenditure_constant_ppp
   - This indicator tracks how much a government spends on education at a specific level, adjusted for inflation and differences in the cost of living. Spending is expressed in constant international dollars, which allows for comparisons across countries and over time.
   - It includes all forms of public education spending — from teacher salaries and textbooks to school maintenance, capital projects like building classrooms, and external funding from international donors that flows through government budgets.
   - Figures are initially reported in local currency, then converted using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates and adjusted to a constant base year. This ensures the numbers reflect real resource commitments rather than changes in local prices or currency fluctuations. For example, data released in 2017 would typically be expressed in 2014 dollars.
   - This measure provides a comparable view of how much governments invest in education in absolute terms. But it doesn’t show how spending is distributed or how effectively it’s used — it should be interpreted alongside indicators like enrolment and per-student spending.

  desc_key_govt_expenditure_constant_ppp_per_student: &desc_key_govt_expenditure_constant_ppp_per_student
   - This indicator shows how much a government spends per student at a particular level of education, expressed in constant international dollars.
   - It’s calculated by dividing total government spending by the number of enrolled students, and adjusted for inflation and differences in purchasing power between countries. This makes it possible to compare investment levels across education systems and over time.
   - It includes all forms of public education spending — from teacher salaries and textbooks to school maintenance, capital projects like building classrooms, and external funding from international donors that flows through government budgets.
   - Figures are initially reported in local currency, then converted using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates and adjusted to a constant base year. This ensures the numbers reflect real resource commitments rather than changes in local prices or currency fluctuations. For example, data released in 2017 would typically be expressed in 2014 dollars.
   - Higher values suggest that more resources are available per student — which could support better infrastructure, teaching quality, and learning environments. But it doesn’t tell us how effectively the money is used, or whether outcomes are improving.
   - This is one of the most useful measures for understanding how governments fund education relative to the size of their student population. It’s especially helpful when comparing countries with different overall budgets or economic conditions.

  desc_key_govt_expenditure_gdp_share: &desc_key_govt_expenditure_gdp_share
   - This indicator shows the share of a country’s economic output (GDP) that is spent on education. It reflects how much of the national budget is directed toward education relative to the size of the economy.
   - It includes all government spending at the relevant education level — from central, regional, and local authorities — and covers both current and capital expenditures.
   - A higher percentage means a larger share of national resources is allocated to education, which may indicate political commitment or policy prioritization. But it doesn’t necessarily mean higher spending per student or better outcomes. Countries with lower GDPs might have high percentages but limited resources in absolute terms.
   - This indicator is useful for understanding how education fits within the broader picture of government spending and national development. It should be interpreted alongside measures like per-student spending and enrolment rates.

  # Enrollment and attendance descriptions
  desc_key_net_enr: &desc_key_net_enr
    - The net enrolment rate shows what percentage of children are enrolled at the education level intended for their age.
    - It compares children enrolled at the correct level for their age to the total population in that same age group. For example, a primary school net enrolment of 90% means 90% of children between the ages of 6 and 11 years are enrolled in primary school. Children who are not enrolled in school or are enrolled at another education level (pre-primary school) are not counted here.
    - The highest possible value is 100%, which would mean all children of the right age are enrolled where they should be. High rates indicate that most children are progressing through school at the expected pace.
    - A rate of 90% doesn't necessarily mean 10% of children are out of school entirely — some may be enrolled at different levels (either higher or lower) than expected for their age, but these students aren't counted in the net rate.
    - The data comes from school administrative records that track enrolment by individual age, combined with population estimates from national statistics offices or UN sources.

  desc_key_ger: &desc_key_ger
    - The gross enrollment ratio counts all students enrolled at a specific education level, regardless of their age. This includes students who are younger or older than the official age range because they started school early, started late, or repeated grades.
    - It measures the total number of students of any age enrolled at an education level as a percentage of the population in the official age group for that level. For example, if primary school is designed for ages 6-11, the gross enrollment ratio compares total primary enrollment (all ages) to the population of 6- to 11-year-olds.
    - Values can exceed 100% when students repeat grades or start late. For instance, primary school enrollment might include 12- or 13-year-olds who started late or repeated grades, pushing the ratio above 100%.
    - A value of 100% does not guarantee that all children in the official age group are enrolled in school; some may be out of school entirely, but the ratio appears high due to older students being counted in the total.
    - Values much lower than 100% indicate that many children of the official age are not enrolled at the expected education level - they may be out of school entirely, enrolled at a different level, or have never started school.
    - Values much higher than 100% can indicate educational challenges such as high grade repetition rates, late school entry, or inefficient progression through the system.
    - The data comes from administrative records such as school enrollment reports, combined with population estimates typically sourced from the United Nations or national statistical offices.

  # Educational attainment descriptions
  desc_key_mye: &desc_key_mye
    - Mean years of schooling shows the average number of years that adults in a country have spent in formal education, giving us a picture of how educated the population is overall.
    - This number is calculated by asking adults about the highest level of school they completed, then figuring out how many years that typically takes. For example, someone who finished high school might have about 12 years of schooling.
    - This indicator measures how much education adults have accumulated over their lifetimes, showing the results of past investments in schools and learning.
    - The data comes from surveys and censuses where adults aged 25 and older report their educational background. Only formal schooling from primary school onwards is counted.
    - Higher numbers mean adults in that country have generally stayed in school longer, showing stronger educational foundations. However, this doesn't tell us about the quality of education, learning outside of school, or whether younger people today are getting better education than the average suggests.

  desc_key_sle: &desc_key_sle
    - Expected years of schooling estimates how long a child starting school today is likely to stay in education, assuming current enrollment patterns continue throughout their schooling years.
    - It is calculated by combining enrollment rates at each level of education and age group, adjusted for the official age of attendance, resulting in the average number of years a child can expect to complete—including time spent repeating grades.
    - The measure reflects access to education rather than completion or learning outcomes, and assumes current patterns remain stable over time.
    - Expected years can be broken down into [pre-primary](#dod:pre-primary-education), [primary](#dod:primary-education), [secondary](#dod:secondary-education), and [tertiary](#dod:tertiary-education), showing the expected time spent at each stage.
    - A higher value means students are expected to spend more time in school. For example, 2.5 years in pre-primary means most children will attend around 2.5 years of preschool; a country with 15 total expected years but only 0.5 in pre-primary likely has limited access to early childhood education.

  # Out-of-school descriptions
  desc_key_out_school: &desc_key_out_school
    - Many children and adolescents around the world are not in school, even though they are old enough to be. This indicator shows how many are missing out on education at each stage of the system.
    - It measures the number of individuals in the official age range for a given level of education who are not enrolled at that level or in any higher level.
    - These children or adolescents may have never entered school, may have dropped out, or may be starting later than expected.
    - The indicator is calculated by subtracting the number of enrolled individuals in a specific age group from the total population of that group, and expressing the result as a percentage.
    - High out-of-school rates signal barriers to access — such as poverty, gender inequality, location, or limited availability of schools — and highlight where more targeted support is needed.
    - The data comes from administrative school enrolment records and household surveys, which provide age-specific insights when compared to population estimates.
    - As with all education data, results should be interpreted carefully. Differences in how enrolment is defined, inconsistencies in age reporting, and timing of data collection (such as during holidays or late in the school year) can affect accuracy.

  # Education system descriptions
  desc_key_private_enrolment: &desc_key_private_enrolment
    - In many countries, education is provided not only by the government but also by private institutions — this indicator shows how much of total enrolment is taking place in privately run schools or educational programmes.
    - It captures the share of students enrolled in private institutions at a given level of education as a percentage of all students enrolled at that level, including both public and private schools.
    - The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of students in private institutions by the total number of students enrolled at the same education level, then multiplying by 100.
    - A high percentage means that non-governmental providers — such as private individuals, companies, religious bodies, or community organizations — play a significant role in delivering education at that level.
    - The data comes from school censuses and other administrative records that report enrolment numbers by type of institution and education level.
    - This indicator is often disaggregated by level of education and by sex, allowing for analysis of how the role of private education differs across schooling stages and between boys and girls.
    - There are some important limitations. In some countries, the distinction between public and private institutions is blurred — especially where private schools receive government subsidies or public funds are used to support student enrolment through scholarships.
    - Additionally, some private schools may operate without formal registration or may not follow national curricula, which can lead to underreporting and incomplete data in official statistics.
    - Despite these challenges, this indicator helps assess the scale and role of the private education sector within a national education system and informs discussions about education financing, accessibility, and regulation.

  desc_key_total_net_attendance: &desc_key_total_net_attendance
    - Many children who are the right age for a level of education are not actually attending school — the total net attendance rate indicator shows how many are, regardless of what level they attend.
    - It captures the percentage of children in the official age group for a given education level who are attending school, whether at the intended level or any other.
    - The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of children of the official age group who are attending school at any level by the total population of children in that age group.
    - For example, if primary education starts at age 7 and lasts six years, the total net attendance rate would be calculated for children aged 7 to 12.
    - A high total net attendance rate means most children of the expected age are participating in school. A low rate signals greater exclusion and highlights where education access needs to be improved.
    - This indicator is the complement to the out-of-school rate. If the attendance rate is low, the equivalent out-of-school rate is high.
    - Data for this indicator comes from household surveys and population censuses, which record attendance status and age. Accurate reference age is critical to ensure that children are grouped correctly.
    - The indicator can be disaggregated by sex, urban or rural location, and household wealth quintiles to help identify population groups that are being left out.
    - There are important technical considerations. Survey data may be collected months after the academic year starts, so the child’s age at data collection may not match the age at the start of the school year.
    - To address this, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) adjusts age data when possible using birth month and year. If only the age in years is reported and the survey was conducted more than six months after the start of the academic year, one year is subtracted from the recorded age.
    - When survey data is collected within five months of the school year’s start, the recorded age is used as-is.
    - Despite adjustments, differences between survey responses and national education structures may affect comparability. Incomplete data — such as missing age, attendance status, or grade — are excluded from the calculation.
    - Even with these limitations, the total net attendance rate is a valuable measure of school participation that complements enrolment data and helps track progress toward universal access to education.

  # Female teachers descriptions
  desc_key_female_teachers: &desc_key_female_teachers
   - Teachers play a central role in shaping learning environments. This indicator shows what share of the teaching workforce at each education level is made up of women.
   - It measures the number of female teachers as a percentage of all teachers at that education level, whether they work full-time or part-time, and whether they teach in person or remotely.
   - The definition focuses on people who are actively teaching students and excludes school administrators like principals who don't teach, as well as volunteers or occasional workers.
   - A value around 50% suggests roughly equal numbers of male and female teachers. Higher percentages mean women make up a larger share of the workforce, while lower values might indicate barriers to women entering teaching.
   - The data comes from administrative records like school censuses or national education registries that track teacher numbers by gender and education level.

        unit: "index"
        description_key:
          - In many countries, men and women have spent different amounts of time in school — this indicator shows how close they are to achieving equality in educational attainment.
          - It captures gender equality in average years of schooling by comparing how many years of formal education have been completed on average by women and men aged 25 and older.
          - The adjusted gender parity index (GPIA) is calculated by dividing the average years of schooling for women by that of men. If the result is greater than 1, it is inverted and subtracted from 2. This creates a scale from 0 to 2, centered around 1.
          - A GPIA value of 1 means men and women have the same average number of completed school years. A value below 1 shows a gap in favour of men, and a value above 1 shows a gap in favour of women.
          - This indicator is useful for highlighting long-term trends in gender inequality in education and assessing the lasting effects of policies aimed at closing the gender gap.
          - The data comes from household surveys or population censuses, where individuals report the highest level of education they have completed. These levels are then converted into years of schooling based on standard durations defined by [International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)](https://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/international-standard-classification-education-isced).
          - Because this indicator reflects accumulated schooling over time, it shows how gender disparities have developed across generations.
          - Some limitations include differences in education system structures between countries and challenges in mapping survey responses to ISCED levels. The indicator measures duration of schooling, not its quality or outcomes.
          - Even so, the GPIA for average years of schooling provides a clear measure of gender equality in education over the life course, and is an important complement to indicators focused on current enrolment or access.

          - It is calculated by dividing the number of international students by the total number of tertiary students in the country, then multiplying by 100.
          - International students include those enrolled in full degree programmes, student exchanges, or as visiting students.
          - Countries with a high share of international students often have well-regarded universities, affordable tuition, or offer courses in widely spoken languages.
          - The data comes from government records and surveys, which usually include details such as the student’s home country and gender.
          - This tells us how open a country’s education system is, and how attractive it is as a place to study.
          - There are some limitations. Students studying at branch campuses of foreign universities may not be included, and countries define “international students” differently.

        - Children around the world begin formal education at different ages — this indicator shows the age at which students are officially expected to start a given level of education in their country.
        - It assumes that students begin schooling on time, attend full-time, and progress without repeating or skipping any grades.
        - The official entrance age is typically determined by national laws or education policies and usually reflects the most common age of entry, though not always.
        - This indicator is essential for understanding how an education system is structured and is used as a reference point when calculating other key indicators like enrolment rates or school-age population estimates.
        - It helps identify the age-specific demand for education services and supports national planning for staffing, infrastructure, and learning materials at each education level.
        - Data on official entrance age is reported by national ministries of education and compiled by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, following [International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)](https://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/international-standard-classification-education-isced) to ensure international comparability.
        - While this provides a standard benchmark, actual school entry may vary due to parental choices, local policies, or flexibility in school admissions.
        - To fully interpret this indicator, it should be considered alongside the theoretical duration of the level of education, which indicates how long students are expected to remain in that level if they follow the system as designed.

        description_key:
          - The theoretical duration of compulsory education refers to the number of years that children are legally required to attend school, as defined by national laws or regulations.
          - This indicator helps determine the school-age population by level of education and is a key input for producing education indicators and assessing a country's education supply capacity in relation to demand.
          - The duration is typically calculated based on the official starting and ending ages for compulsory education, assuming students progress through the system without repeating or skipping grades.
          - For example, if compulsory education starts at age 6 and ends at age 15, the theoretical duration would be 9 years.
          - Data on compulsory education duration are collected from national legislation and formal education standards, and are mapped to the [International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)](https://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/international-standard-classification-education-isced) to ensure international comparability.
          - It's important to note that while legislation may define the duration of compulsory education, actual implementation and enforcement can vary, and some children may not attend school for the full duration.
          - Changes in national education policies, such as extending or reducing the years of compulsory education, can impact this indicator and should be considered when analyzing trends over time.
          - This indicator is useful for understanding government commitment to education and for planning resource allocation, but it should be interpreted alongside other indicators like enrolment rates and completion rates for a comprehensive view.

          - Children begin their education journeys at different ages around the world — this indicator shows the age at which they are officially expected to start pre-primary education in a given country.
          - It captures the official entrance age for pre-primary education, based on the assumption that children begin schooling at the standard age, attend full-time, and progress through the education system without repeating or skipping any grades.
          - The official entrance age is typically set by national education laws or regulations and often corresponds to the most common age at which children enter pre-primary programmes.
          - This indicator helps estimate the expected demand for early childhood education services and is a key input for producing many other education statistics, including enrolment rates and school-age population estimates.
          - The data are reported by ministries of education and compiled by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, using the International Standard Classification of Education ([International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)](https://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/international-standard-classification-education-isced)) to ensure international comparability.
          - While the official age provides a national benchmark, actual entry ages may vary due to cultural preferences, availability of early childhood programmes, or local policy flexibility.

        description_key:
          - Boys and girls don’t always have equal access to primary education — this indicator shows how close we are to gender parity in age-appropriate school enrolment.
          - It captures gender equality in net enrolment rates for primary education by comparing the percentage of girls and boys of official primary school age who are enrolled at the primary level.
          - The adjusted gender parity index (GPIA) is calculated by dividing the female net enrolment rate by the male net enrolment rate. If the result is greater than 1, it is inverted and subtracted from 2. This adjustment produces a value between 0 and 2 that is symmetrical around 1.
          - A GPIA value of 1 indicates perfect parity. A value below 1 shows a gap in favour of boys, while a value above 1 shows a gap in favour of girls.
          - This indicator is useful for identifying gender-based barriers to primary school enrolment and for monitoring progress toward equitable access to basic education.
          - The data comes from administrative records reporting enrolment by age and sex, as well as population estimates for children of official primary school age.
          - It’s important to interpret this indicator alongside others, such as attendance rates or completion rates, to get a full picture of gender disparities in education.
          - As with all indicators based on enrolment and population estimates, small inconsistencies between data sources may affect accuracy. Differences may also arise due to early or delayed school entry, which can influence age-specific enrolment.
          - Despite these limitations, the GPIA for net enrolment in primary education is a valuable measure of progress toward inclusive and equitable education for all children, regardless of gender.

          - This indicator is useful for identifying gender-based disparities in lower secondary school enrolment and for tracking progress toward equitable access to post-primary education.
          - The data comes from administrative records reporting enrolment by age and sex, along with population estimates for children in the official lower secondary school age range.
          - It should be interpreted alongside related indicators — such as attendance, progression, and completion rates — to build a clearer picture of gender equity in education beyond access alone.
          - Like all indicators derived from enrolment and population estimates, data inconsistencies or timing issues, such as early or delayed school entry, may affect the accuracy of age-specific enrolment figures.
          - Despite these limitations, the GPIA for net enrolment in lower secondary education remains a powerful tool for assessing gender equity and informing inclusive education policy.

          - It captures the percentage of total public education spending in public institutions that is allocated specifically to staff compensation, including both teaching and non-teaching personnel.
          - The indicator is calculated by dividing staff compensation spending by total public education spending, and multiplying by 100. It can also be further broken down by staff type or level of education.
          - A higher percentage suggests a larger portion of education funding is directed toward salaries and benefits, which can reflect government policy priorities and investment in teacher recruitment, retention, and motivation.
          - The data comes from administrative financial records, often sourced from ministries of finance or education, or from national statistical offices through the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) or UNESCO-OECD-Eurostat (UOE) surveys.
          - This indicator is disaggregated by level of education, making it possible to compare spending patterns across primary, secondary, or tertiary education.
          - It should be interpreted in context, alongside indicators on capital investment, material spending (such as textbooks), and total spending per student.
          - Over time, changes in this indicator may reflect shifts in education budgeting priorities — such as reforms to teacher salary structures or investments in learning materials.
          - Limitations include incomplete coverage when data from only one ministry is reported, or when education-related spending by other government bodies is excluded. Differences in fiscal and academic years may also affect the timing of reported spending.
          - Despite these challenges, the share of education spending on staff compensation offers key insights into how resources are distributed within education systems and the role that teachers and support staff play in public education investment.

          - The indicator is calculated by dividing staff compensation spending by total public education spending, and multiplying by 100. It can also be further broken down by staff type or level of education.
          - A higher percentage suggests a larger portion of education funding is directed toward salaries and benefits, which can reflect government policy priorities and investment in teacher recruitment, retention, and motivation.
          - The data comes from administrative financial records, often sourced from ministries of finance or education, or from national statistical offices through the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) or UNESCO-OECD-Eurostat (UOE) surveys.
          - This indicator is disaggregated by level of education, making it possible to compare spending patterns across primary, secondary, or tertiary education.
          - It should be interpreted in context, alongside indicators on capital investment, material spending (such as textbooks), and total spending per student.
          - Over time, changes in this indicator may reflect shifts in education budgeting priorities — such as reforms to teacher salary structures or investments in learning materials.
          - Limitations include incomplete coverage when data from only one ministry is reported, or when education-related spending by other government bodies is excluded. Differences in fiscal and academic years may also affect the timing of reported spending.

        title: School life expectancy in primary education, adjusted gender parity index
        description_short: An [adjusted gender parity index](#dod:adjusted-gpi) of 1 indicates equality in the expected number of years a child of school entrance age is likely to spend in [primary](#dod:primary-education) school between boys and girls. Values below 1 favor boys, and above 1 favor girls.
        unit: "index"
        description_key:
            - In many countries, boys and girls do not spend the same amount of time in primary school — this indicator shows how close they are to parity in expected school duration at the primary level.
            - It focuses specifically on school life expectancy in [primary education](#dod:primary-education), comparing the average number of years girls and boys are expected to spend in primary school based on current age-specific enrolment rates.
            - The adjusted gender parity index (GPIA) is calculated by dividing the female school life expectancy in primary education by the male school life expectancy. If the result exceeds 1, it is inverted and subtracted from 2 to produce a symmetrical scale from 0 to 2, with 1 representing perfect parity.
            - A value of 1 means boys and girls are expected to spend the same number of years in primary school. Values below 1 indicate boys are expected to spend more time in school; values above 1 indicate girls are.
            - This indicator assumes current enrolment trends continue over time and includes all children, even those who may never enrol, giving a comprehensive view of participation in primary education.
            - The data comes from administrative sources such as school censuses and registers, as well as population estimates by age, typically provided by national statistical offices or the United Nations Population Division.
            - Disaggregated by sex, this indicator helps identify gender gaps in access to and retention in primary schooling.
            - As with all expectancy-based indicators, it does not reflect actual completion or quality of education and may not account for repetition or part-time attendance, which can vary across contexts.

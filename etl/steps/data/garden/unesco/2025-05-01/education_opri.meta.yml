  desc_key_net_enr: &desc_key_net_enr
    - The *net enrolment rate* (NER) shows the percentage of children in the official age group for a given level of education who are enrolled at that same level.
    - It helps measure how well an education system covers the population it is designed to serve, focusing only on children who are the correct age for that level.
    - The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of students of the official age who are enrolled at a specific level of education by the total population of that age group.
    - For example, if primary education in a country begins at age 7 and lasts six years, the official primary school age group would be ages 7 to 12.
    - A high *net enrolment rate* indicates that most children of the correct age are enrolled in school at the appropriate level. The maximum theoretical value is 100%.
    - Data for the *net enrolment rate* comes from school administrative records, which provide enrolment figures by single year of age, and from population data, usually derived from national statistics offices or UN estimates.
    - The indicator is useful for tracking progress toward universal primary and secondary education, but it does not account for students who are over-age or under-age for their grade level.
    - When compared to the *gross enrolment rate* (GER), the *net enrolment rate* highlights how many students are enrolled at the expected age, while the *gross enrolment rate* includes students of all ages.
    - There are some important limitations. *Net enrolment rate* values may be distorted if there are inconsistencies in enrolment or population data, and in some cases, values slightly above 100% may occur.
    - Challenges also arise when official entry ages do not align with actual birth dates or when many students begin school earlier or later than expected.
    - The *net enrolment rate* is not applicable at the tertiary level due to wide variations in the age at which people enter and complete higher education.

  desc_key_mye: &desc_key_mye
     - The *mean years of schooling* (MYS) indicator measures the average number of completed years of formal education for a specific population group, typically adults aged 25 and older, excluding repeated years.
     - The data comes from population censuses and household or labour force surveys, which collect information on the highest level of education completed. These levels are matched with their official durations using the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED).
     - This indicator helps track long-term gender disparities in educational attainment and provides insight into the distribution of educational opportunities over time.
     - It is important to note that this measure reflects only the duration of schooling, not the quality of education or learning outcomes.
     - Comparisons across countries can be challenging, as education systems differ and some qualifications may be classified differently.

  desc_key_ger: &desc_key_ger
    - The *gross enrolment ratio* (GER) shows the total number of students enrolled in a specific level of education, regardless of age, as a percentage of the population in the official age group for that level.
    - It provides a broad measure of participation in education and helps indicate the capacity of the education system to serve its population.
    - The indicator is calculated by dividing total enrolment in a given level of education by the total population of the age group officially corresponding to that level.
    - For example, if primary school starts at age 7 and lasts six years, the official age group would be ages 7 to 12.
    - A high *gross enrolment ratio* suggests that the system accommodates a large number of students, but it does not mean all students are from the intended age group.
    - The *gross enrolment ratio* includes both over-aged and under-aged students due to factors like late school entry, early entry, or grade repetition.
    - A GER value close to or above 100% means that the number of enrolled students equals or exceeds the size of the official age group. This can indicate widespread access but does not necessarily reflect age-appropriate enrolment.
    - The data comes from administrative records, including school registers and censuses, and population estimates are typically sourced from the United Nations Population Division (UNPD) or national statistics offices.
    - Although GER is useful for gauging system capacity, it cannot on its own determine whether all children of the correct age are in school. It should be interpreted alongside the *net enrolment rate* to assess age-appropriate participation.
    - One limitation of GER is that values can exceed 100% due to the inclusion of over-aged and under-aged students. Additional data is needed to fully understand the causes, such as grade repetition or delayed entry.
    - The *gross enrolment ratio* is not a direct measure of efficiency or equity but offers a useful overview of how many people the education system is currently serving.

  desc_key_prim_out_school: &desc_key_prim_out_school
    - Many children who are old enough for primary school are not attending any kind of schoolâ€”this indicator tells us how many.
    - It captures the number of children in the official primary school age range, typically 6 to 11 years old, who are not enrolled in either primary or secondary education.
    - The indicator is calculated by subtracting the number of enrolled primary-age children from the total number of children in that age group.
    - These children may have never started school, may have dropped out early, or may be starting late and have not yet enrolled.
    - The data comes from school administrative records, which report enrolment figures, and from household surveys, which help capture children missed by official data sources.
    - There are some important limitations to consider. Inconsistencies between enrolment and population data from different sources may lead to inaccurate estimates.
    - Surveys conducted late in the school year may count children as out of school even if they are about to enrol, leading to overestimates.
    - Children who are enrolled but not attending regularly may not always be captured correctly, depending on how data is collected and defined.

          - This indicator assesses gender equality in mean years of schooling by comparing the average number of completed years of education between women and men aged 25 and older.
          - It is based on the adjusted gender parity index (GPIA), which is calculated by dividing the female value for mean years of schooling by the male value. If the result is greater than 1, the ratio is inverted and subtracted from 2 to keep the scale symmetrical between 0 and 2.
          - A value of 1 means that men and women have equal average years of schooling. A value below 1 indicates that men have more years of schooling, while a value above 1 indicates that women have more.

  desc_key_net_enr: &desc_key_net_enr
    - Not all children of the right age are enrolled in the level of education intended for them— the *net enrolment rate* indicator shows how many are.
    - It captures the percentage of children in the official age group for a specific education level who are enrolled at that same level, such as primary or lower-secondary.
    - The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of students of the correct age enrolled in that level by the total number of children in that age group.
    - For example, if primary education starts at age 7 and lasts six years, the official primary school age range would be 7 to 12 years.
    - A high *net enrolment rate* means that most children are enrolled where they are expected to be. The highest possible value is 100%.
    - The data comes from school administrative records, which track enrolment by single year of age, and from population estimates provided by national statistics offices or UN sources.
    - This indicator is especially useful for monitoring progress toward universal primary and secondary education.
    - However, it does not account for children who are enrolled in the correct level but are too young or too old, and it may miss students enrolled in the “wrong” grade for their age.
    - Differences between enrolment and population data can lead to small errors. In some cases, the *net enrolment rate* may slightly exceed 100%.
    - It's also not applied to tertiary education because of the wide range of entry ages and programme lengths at that level.

  desc_key_mye: &desc_key_mye
    - Adults around the world have spent different amounts of time in school—this indicator shows the average number of years completed by people aged 25 and older.
    - It reflects the total years of formal education that adults have successfully finished, excluding any years they may have repeated.
    - The data comes from censuses and household surveys, where adults report the highest level of education they completed. These levels are then matched to standard durations using the ISCED framework.
    - This is a valuable indicator for understanding long-term trends in educational attainment and gender equality.
    - However, it only measures how long people stayed in school—not what they learned or whether they received a quality education.
    - Cross-country comparisons can be challenging. Education systems differ in how long programmes last, and qualifications may not be classified in the same way.

  desc_key_ger: &desc_key_ger
    - Many students are enrolled in school at different ages—the *gross enrolment ratio* shows how many are participating in a given level of education, regardless of whether they are the “right” age for it.
    - It captures the total number of students enrolled at a specific education level, expressed as a percentage of the population in the official age group for that level.
    - For example, if upper-secondary school is designed for ages 15 to 17, the *gross enrolment ratio* compares total enrolment at that level to the population of 15- to 17-year-olds.
    - A high value means many people are accessing education at that level, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that they are in the appropriate grade for their age.
    - The *gross enrolment ratio* includes students who are younger or older than expected due to late entry, early entry, or grade repetition.
    - The data comes from administrative records, such as school enrolment reports, and from population estimates, usually provided by UN or national sources.
    - A *gross enrolment ratio* close to or above 100% can indicate strong system capacity, but it doesn’t tell us whether every school-age child is enrolled.
    - This indicator is best understood when used together with the *net enrolment rate*, which focuses on age-appropriate participation.
    - One limitation is that the *gross enrolment ratio* can exceed 100%, which may require further data to understand the reasons—such as whether students are repeating grades or starting school late.

  desc_key_prim_out_school: &desc_key_prim_out_school
    - Many children who are old enough for primary school are not attending any kind of school—this indicator tells us how many.
    - It captures the number of children in the official primary school age range, typically 6 to 11 years old, who are not enrolled in either primary or secondary education.
    - The indicator is calculated by subtracting the number of enrolled primary-age children from the total number of children in that age group.
    - These children may have never started school, may have dropped out early, or may be starting late and have not yet enrolled.
    - The data comes from school administrative records, which report enrolment figures, and from household surveys, which help capture children missed by official data sources.
    - There are some important limitations to consider. Inconsistencies between enrolment and population data from different sources may lead to inaccurate estimates.
    - Surveys conducted late in the school year may count children as out of school even if they are about to enrol, leading to overestimates.
    - Children who are enrolled but not attending regularly may not always be captured correctly, depending on how data is collected and defined.

  deck_key_low_out_school: &deck_key_low_out_school
    - Many adolescents who are old enough for lower-secondary school are not attending any kind of school—this indicator tells us how many.
    - It captures the number of children in the official lower-secondary school age range, typically around 12 to 14 or 13 to 15 years old, who are not enrolled in any level of education—neither lower-secondary nor any other level.
    - The indicator is calculated by subtracting the number of enrolled lower-secondary-age children from the total number of children in that age group.
    - These adolescents may have never transitioned from primary school, may have dropped out early, or may be delayed in entering the lower-secondary level.
    - The data comes from school administrative records, which report enrolment figures by single year of age, and from household surveys, which help capture students missed in administrative data.
    - There are some important limitations to consider. Inconsistencies between enrolment and population data from different sources may lead to inaccurate estimates.
    - Surveys conducted late in the school year may count students as out of school even if they are about to enrol, which can lead to overestimates.
    - Adolescents who are technically enrolled but do not attend regularly may not be captured accurately, depending on how the data is collected.

  desc_key_up_out_school: &desc_key_up_out_school
    - Many young people who are old enough for upper-secondary school are not enrolled—this indicator shows how many are missing from education.
    - It captures the number of youth in the official upper-secondary age range, typically around 15 to 17 or 16 to 18 years old, who are not enrolled in any school level.
    - The indicator is calculated by subtracting the number of enrolled upper-secondary-age students from the total number of youth in that age group.
    - These youth may have never transitioned from lower-secondary, may have dropped out due to academic, economic, or social reasons, or may be delayed in their education.
    - The data comes from administrative records, such as school censuses, and household surveys that track school attendance and enrolment by age.
    - There are important limitations to note. Differences between data sources and definitions of age or enrolment status may result in under- or over-estimates.
    - If surveys are carried out late in the school year, they may miscount youth who are late entrants or re-enrolling, leading to overestimates of those out of school.
    - Some young people may be enrolled but not attending classes regularly, which may not be reflected in the data depending on the collection method.

  desc_key_completion: &desc_key_completion
    - Many children and young people never make it to the final grade of their school level—this indicator shows how many complete their education by a slightly older age than expected.
    - It captures the percentage of a population group, aged 3 to 5 years above the official age for the last grade of a given level of education, who have successfully completed that level.
    - The completion age group is defined based on the age at which students would finish schooling if they started on time, progressed without repeating, and followed the expected path. For example, if primary school starts at age 6 and lasts six years, the completion rate is measured among 14- to 16-year-olds.
    - The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of people in this older age group who have completed the final grade of the education level by the total number of people in that group.
    - A high completion rate—close to 100%—means that nearly all children have completed a given level by the expected time with some allowance for delays. A low rate may indicate late school entry, dropout, repetition, or other disruptions.
    - The data comes primarily from household surveys and censuses that ask about the highest grade completed by each person, along with information about their age. This is combined with official data on school structure, including starting ages and duration of each level.
    - Completion rates can be broken down by sex, urban or rural location, and household wealth to help identify gaps in access and progression.
    - There are limitations to keep in mind. If survey responses on completed grades don’t match national ISCED classifications, cross-country comparability can be affected. Programme completion may be underestimated if official durations differ from what individuals actually experience.
    - Older cohorts can also be harder to classify accurately when countries change the duration or structure of education over time.
    - Despite these challenges, completion rate is a key indicator for understanding how many children and youth make it through the education system—and where they may be falling behind.

  desc_key_private_enrolment: &desc_key_private_enrolment
    - In many countries, education is provided not only by the government but also by private institutions—this indicator shows how much of total enrolment is taking place in privately run schools or educational programmes.
    - It captures the share of students enrolled in private institutions at a given level of education as a percentage of all students enrolled at that level, including both public and private schools.
    - The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of students in private institutions by the total number of students enrolled at the same education level, then multiplying by 100.
    - A high percentage means that non-governmental providers—such as private individuals, companies, religious bodies, or community organizations—play a significant role in delivering education at that level.
    - The data comes from school censuses and other administrative records that report enrolment numbers by type of institution and education level.
    - This indicator is often disaggregated by level of education and by sex, allowing for analysis of how the role of private education differs across schooling stages and between boys and girls.
    - There are some important limitations. In some countries, the distinction between public and private institutions is blurred—especially where private schools receive government subsidies or public funds are used to support student enrolment through scholarships.
    - Additionally, some private schools may operate without formal registration or may not follow national curricula, which can lead to underreporting and incomplete data in official statistics.
    - Despite these challenges, this indicator helps assess the scale and role of the private education sector within a national education system and informs discussions about education financing, accessibility, and regulation.

  desc_key_total_net_attendance: &desc_key_total_net_attendance
    - Many children who are the right age for a level of education are not actually attending school—the *total net attendance rate* indicator shows how many are, regardless of what level they attend.
    - It captures the percentage of children in the official age group for a given education level who are attending school, whether at the intended level or any other.
    - The indicator is calculated by dividing the number of children of the official age group who are attending school at any level by the total population of children in that age group.
    - For example, if primary education starts at age 7 and lasts six years, the total net attendance rate would be calculated for children aged 7 to 12.
    - A high *total net attendance rate* means most children of the expected age are participating in school. A low rate signals greater exclusion and highlights where education access needs to be improved.
    - This indicator is the complement to the out-of-school rate. If the attendance rate is low, the equivalent out-of-school rate is high.
    - Data for this indicator comes from household surveys and population censuses, which record attendance status and age. Accurate reference age is critical to ensure that children are grouped correctly.
    - The indicator can be disaggregated by sex, urban or rural location, and household wealth quintiles to help identify population groups that are being left out.
    - There are important technical considerations. Survey data may be collected months after the academic year starts, so the child’s age at data collection may not match the age at the start of the school year.
    - To address this, the UIS adjusts age data when possible using birth month and year. If only the age in years is reported and the survey was conducted more than six months after the start of the academic year, one year is subtracted from the recorded age.
    - When survey data is collected within five months of the school year’s start, the recorded age is used as-is.
    - Despite adjustments, differences between survey responses and national education structures may affect comparability. Incomplete data—such as missing age, attendance status, or grade—are excluded from the calculation.
    - Even with these limitations, the *total net attendance rate* is a valuable measure of school participation that complements enrolment data and helps track progress toward universal access to education.

        description_short: An [adjusted gender parity index](#dod:adjusted-gpi) of 1 indicates equal average years of schooling between men and women. Values below 1 favor men, and above 1 favor women.
        unit: "index"
        description_key:
          - In many countries, men and women have spent different amounts of time in school—this indicator shows how close they are to achieving equality in educational attainment.
          - It captures gender equality in *average years of schooling* by comparing how many years of formal education have been completed on average by women and men aged 25 and older.
          - The *adjusted gender parity index (GPIA)* is calculated by dividing the average years of schooling for women by that of men. If the result is greater than 1, it is inverted and subtracted from 2. This creates a scale from 0 to 2, centered around 1.
          - A GPIA value of 1 means men and women have the same average number of completed school years. A value below 1 shows a gap in favour of men, and a value above 1 shows a gap in favour of women.
          - This indicator is useful for highlighting long-term trends in gender inequality in education and assessing the lasting effects of policies aimed at closing the gender gap.
          - The data comes from household surveys or population censuses, where individuals report the highest level of education they have completed. These levels are then converted into years of schooling based on standard durations defined by ISCED.
          - Because this indicator reflects accumulated schooling over time, it shows how gender disparities have developed across generations.
          - Some limitations include differences in education system structures between countries and challenges in mapping survey responses to ISCED levels. The indicator measures duration of schooling, not its quality or outcomes.
          - Even so, the GPIA for *average years of schooling* provides a clear measure of gender equality in education over the life course, and is an important complement to indicators focused on current enrolment or access.

      school_life_expectancy__primary__adjusted_gender_parity_index__gpia:
        title: School life expectancy in primary education
        description_short: An [adjusted gender parity index](#dod:adjusted-gpi) of 1 indicates equality in the expected number of years a child of school entrance age is likely to spend in [primary](#dod:primary-education) school between boys and girls. Values below 1 favor boys, and above 1 favor girls.
        unit: "index"
        description_key:
          - In many countries, boys and girls spend different lengths of time in school—this indicator shows how close they are to parity in the total number of years of schooling they can expect to receive.
          - It captures gender equality in *school life expectancy* by comparing the average number of years of education a girl can expect to receive with that of a boy, based on current enrolment rates at each age.
          - The *adjusted gender parity index (GPIA)* is calculated by dividing the female school life expectancy by the male school life expectancy. If the result exceeds 1, it is inverted and subtracted from 2, producing a scale from 0 to 2, with 1 indicating exact parity.
          - A value of 1 means girls and boys are expected to spend the same number of years in school. A value below 1 indicates boys are expected to stay longer in school, and a value above 1 means the advantage is with girls.
          - School life expectancy is based on the assumption that current age-specific enrolment patterns continue in the future. It includes children who may never enrol and reflects system-wide participation across all levels of education.
          - The data comes from administrative records, including school registers and censuses, and from population estimates by single year of age, typically provided by national sources or the United Nations Population Division.
          - This indicator is disaggregated by sex and level of education, helping to identify gaps in participation across different stages of schooling.
          - As with all school expectancy measures, this does not reflect the quality of education or actual grade completion. It also does not account for grade repetition or part-time study, which can vary by country.
          - While limitations exist, the *GPIA for school life expectancy* is a valuable tool for understanding gender disparities in access and continuity within the education system over a child’s expected schooling years.

      outbound_mobility_ratio__all_regions__both_sexes__uis_estimate__pct:
        title: Share of students studying abroad
        description_short: Percentage of a country's [tertiary](#dod:tertiary-education) level students studying abroad as international students.

        description_key:
          - Many students leave their home country to pursue higher education abroad—this indicator shows what share of a country's tertiary students choose to study in another country.
          - It captures the percentage of students from a given country who are enrolled in tertiary education abroad, relative to the total number of students enrolled in tertiary education at home.
          - The outbound mobility ratio is calculated by dividing the number of students from a country who are studying abroad by the total number of students enrolled in tertiary education within that country.
          - A high outbound mobility ratio means a significant portion of students are going abroad for their studies, which may indicate limited domestic capacity or quality concerns in the home country’s tertiary education system.
          - The data comes from international education surveys and administrative records, including national higher education management systems and institutional reports.
          - This indicator can be broken down by sex, ISCED level, and destination region, helping to analyze patterns of international study and gender dynamics in student mobility.
          - There are some important limitations. Not all countries have a system for tracking outbound students, and some receiving countries may not report enrolment figures by country of origin.
          - Definitions of what counts as a “mobile student” can vary, affecting comparability between countries and over time.
          - Despite these challenges, the *outbound mobility ratio* offers valuable insight into global student flows and highlights international dimensions of access, choice, and demand in tertiary education.

        description_key:
          - Governments allocate part of their national income to fund education—this indicator shows how much is spent specifically on secondary education relative to the overall economy.
          - It captures the percentage of students from other countries who are enrolled in all levels of tertiary education (ISCED 5 to 8) in a given country, relative to total tertiary enrolment in that same country.
          - The inbound mobility rate is calculated by dividing the number of internationally mobile students studying in the country by the total number of students enrolled in tertiary education within that country.
          - A high inbound mobility rate reflects a strong capacity to attract foreign students and signals that the country may be seen as a hub for international higher education.
          - The data comes from administrative records, such as national higher education information systems and surveys, and includes enrolment disaggregated by country of origin, ISCED level, and sex.
          - This indicator is useful for assessing the international openness of a country's higher education system and understanding student flow patterns across borders.
          - There are several limitations to consider. The indicator may not capture students studying at foreign university branches or campuses within the reporting country, which can lead to underestimation.
          - In addition, how countries define and report “mobile students” can vary, making comparisons between countries less straightforward.
          - Despite these challenges, the *inbound mobility rate* provides important insights into a country’s role in global education and its attractiveness as a destination for international students.

      official_entrance_age_to_compulsory_education__years:
        title: Official entrance age to compulsory education
        description_short: The official age for entering compulsory education is based on students starting at the earliest entrance age, studying full-time, and advancing without grade repetition or skipping.
        unit: "years"
        description_key:
        - Children around the world begin formal education at different ages—this indicator shows the age at which students are officially expected to start a given level of education in their country.
        - It assumes that students begin schooling on time, attend full-time, and progress without repeating or skipping any grades.
        - The official entrance age is typically determined by national laws or education policies and usually reflects the most common age of entry, though not always.
        - This indicator is essential for understanding how an education system is structured and is used as a reference point when calculating other key indicators like enrolment rates or school-age population estimates.
        - It helps identify the age-specific demand for education services and supports national planning for staffing, infrastructure, and learning materials at each education level.
        - Data on official entrance age is reported by national ministries of education and compiled by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, following ISCED classifications to ensure international comparability.
        - While this provides a standard benchmark, actual school entry may vary due to parental choices, local policies, or flexibility in school admissions.
        - To fully interpret this indicator, it should be considered alongside the *theoretical duration* of the level of education, which indicates how long students are expected to remain in that level if they follow the system as designed.

      duration_of_compulsory_education__years:
        title: Duration of compulsory education
        description_short: The number of years of compulsory education is based on students starting at the earliest entrance age, studying full-time, and advancing without grade repetition or skipping.
        unit: "years"

          - The *theoretical duration of compulsory education* refers to the number of years that children are legally required to attend school, as defined by national laws or regulations.
          - This indicator helps determine the school-age population by level of education and is a key input for producing education indicators and assessing a country's education supply capacity in relation to demand.
          - The duration is typically calculated based on the official starting and ending ages for compulsory education, assuming students progress through the system without repeating or skipping grades.
          - For example, if compulsory education starts at age 6 and ends at age 15, the theoretical duration would be 9 years.
          - Data on compulsory education duration are collected from national legislation and formal education standards, and are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure international comparability.
          - It's important to note that while legislation may define the duration of compulsory education, actual implementation and enforcement can vary, and some children may not attend school for the full duration.
          - Changes in national education policies, such as extending or reducing the years of compulsory education, can impact this indicator and should be considered when analyzing trends over time.
          - This indicator is useful for understanding government commitment to education and for planning resource allocation, but it should be interpreted alongside other indicators like enrolment rates and completion rates for a comprehensive view.
          - Limitations include potential discrepancies between legal provisions and actual practice, and differences in how countries define and implement compulsory education.

          - Governments allocate part of their national income to fund education—this indicator shows how much is spent specifically on primary education relative to the overall economy.
          - It captures the share of total general government expenditure on education that goes to primary education, including spending by local, regional, and central government authorities.
          - The indicator is calculated by dividing government expenditure on primary education by total expenditure on education across all levels, and multiplying by 100.
          - A higher percentage means that a greater share of education funding is being directed toward primary education, which may reflect a government’s priority for foundational learning.
          - The data comes from official sources reported to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, and is mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure global comparability.
          - This indicator is useful for understanding how governments prioritize different stages of education. It should be interpreted alongside data on enrolment and per-student costs, which can influence how funding is allocated.
          - There are some limitations. In some cases, expenditure by education level is estimated, and it may be difficult to separate primary from pre-primary or lower from upper-secondary education.
          - The reference year usually reflects the end of the school year, which may span two calendar years depending on the country.
          - Despite these challenges, the *share of education spending on primary education* offers valuable insight into national priorities and the public investment made in the earliest years of formal learning.

        description_key:
          - Boys and girls don’t always have equal access to primary education—this indicator shows how close we are to gender parity in age-appropriate school enrolment.
          - It captures gender equality in *net enrolment rates* for primary education by comparing the percentage of girls and boys of official primary school age who are enrolled at the primary level.
          - The *adjusted gender parity index (GPIA)* is calculated by dividing the female net enrolment rate by the male net enrolment rate. If the result is greater than 1, it is inverted and subtracted from 2. This adjustment produces a value between 0 and 2 that is symmetrical around 1.
          - A GPIA value of 1 indicates perfect parity. A value below 1 shows a gap in favour of boys, while a value above 1 shows a gap in favour of girls.
          - This indicator is useful for identifying gender-based barriers to primary school enrolment and for monitoring progress toward equitable access to basic education.
          - The data comes from administrative records reporting enrolment by age and sex, as well as population estimates for children of official primary school age.
          - It’s important to interpret this indicator alongside others, such as attendance rates or completion rates, to get a full picture of gender disparities in education.
          - As with all indicators based on enrolment and population estimates, small inconsistencies between data sources may affect accuracy. Differences may also arise due to early or delayed school entry, which can influence age-specific enrolment.
          - Despite these limitations, the GPIA for *net enrolment in primary education* is a valuable measure of progress toward inclusive and equitable education for all children, regardless of gender.

  common_total_vax: &common_total_vax
    - Vaccination data reflects the total number of doses administered—covering both primary series and booster doses—and are now sourced exclusively from WHO.
    - Rapid vaccine development and ongoing updates for emerging variants underline the dynamic nature of COVID-19 vaccination efforts globally.
    - Coverage statistics can exceed 100% if population estimates do not keep pace with migration or demographic changes, leading to inaccuracies in denominators. Also, we rely on population estimates in 2022 by UN WPP.
  common_booster_vax: &common_booster_vax
    - These data focus on the administration of booster doses, which are crucial for maintaining immunity as the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to evolve.
    - Rapid vaccine development and ongoing updates for emerging variants underline the dynamic nature of COVID-19 vaccination efforts globally.
    - Ongoing updates to vaccine formulations and recommendations emphasize the dynamic nature of COVID-19 booster efforts globally.

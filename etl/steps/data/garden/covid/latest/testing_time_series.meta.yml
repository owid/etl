        description: >-
          The series is smoothed by averaging daily figures over a rolling 7-day window.


          Not all countries report testing data on a daily basis. To generate this series we assume that testing changed equally
          on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported.


          Tests may refer to the number of tests performed or the number of people tested – depending on which is reported
          by the particular country.

          The series is smoothed by averaging daily figures over a rolling 7-day window.


          Not all countries report testing data on a daily basis. To generate this series we assume that testing changed equally
          on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported. This produces a complete series of daily figures,
          which is then averaged over a rolling 7-day window.


          Tests may refer to the number of tests performed or the number of people tested – depending on which is reported
          by the particular country.

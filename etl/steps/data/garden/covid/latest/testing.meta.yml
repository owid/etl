          - Testing is a key tool for identifying infections, guiding treatment, isolating positive cases, tracing contacts, and allocating healthcare resources.
          - "The number of COVID-19 tests is not measured uniformly across countries: some track 'tests performed', while others count 'people tested'."
          - Most reported data includes PCR and antigen tests; antibody tests are generally excluded since they are less relevant for current infection tracking.
          - At-home self-tests may be counted if reported nationally, but many countries still rely primarily on laboratory tests for confirmation.
          - Varying reporting standards and test definitions can complicate international comparisons and the interpretation of testing statistics.

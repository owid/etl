          {definitions.others.description}
        description_key:
          - The ICL model is a stochastic SEIR variant that “back-calculates" likely infections by linking reported deaths to an estimated infection fatality rate (IFR) and mobility trends.
          - Since the model relies on confirmed deaths and assumed IFR values, any under-reporting or mismatches in demographic factors can introduce uncertainties and potentially underestimate the true infection burden.
          - Designed initially for low- and middle-income countries, the model's projections (including Rt, hospital demand, and ICU needs) hinge on accurate input data, making real-world reporting gaps a key limitation.
          - Like all models, this one makes many assumptions, for a full list see the [model methods description](https://mrc-ide.github.io/global-lmic-reports/parameters.html).

        description_short: |-
          <% set model_name = "IHME" %>
          {definitions.others.description}
        description_key:
          - IHME's hybrid model combines a statistical "death model" with an SEIR component, fitting infection estimates by using confirmed deaths and an assumed infection fatality rate (IFR).
          - The IFR is partly derived from data on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and New Zealand, meaning any inaccuracies in these sources may affect the overall infection estimates.
          - The model accounts for a wide range of factors (e.g., mobility data, policy changes, and population density) to gauge how interventions and behavior impact transmission rates.
          - Underestimation or overestimation can occur if critical assumptions—such as how testing levels reduce the case fatality rate—do not align with real-world dynamics.
          - IHME paused its routine COVID-19 modeling after December 16, 2022, so estimates beyond this point are no longer updated.
          - More details are discussed in the [model FAQs](http://www.healthdata.org/covid/faqs) and in different [estimation update reports](http://www.healthdata.org/covid/updates).

        description_short: |-
          <% set model_name = "LSHTM" %>
          {definitions.others.description}
        description_key:
          - LSHTM uses a delay-adjusted CFR comparison to estimate how many symptomatic infections go undetected, then adds an assumed 10-70% asymptomatic share to estimate total infections.
          - A baseline CFR of 1.4% - derived from early data in China - underpins the model, potentially leading to overestimation or underestimation of infections in populations with different age structures.
          - By assuming confirmed deaths reflect true deaths, the model may underestimate the actual health burden in places where fatalities are underreported or reported with delays.
          - Retroactive revisions in death data can introduce discrepancies, affecting the model's calculations of under-ascertainment rates.
          - While it highlights under-detection of infections, the model's accuracy depends heavily on its baseline CFR assumptions and the completeness of reported deaths data.
          - More assumptions and limitations are discussed in [the full report](https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/reports/UnderReporting.pdf).

        description_short: |-
          <% set model_name = "Youyang Gu" %>
          {definitions.others.description}
        description_key:
          - The model combines a standard SEIR framework with a machine-learning layer that adjusts parameters to align with observed data, aiming for forecast accuracy.
          - Using reported deaths and an estimated infection fatality rate (IFR) to back-calculate infections can introduce uncertainty, especially if actual deaths are underreported.
          - The model assumes that IFR decreases over time (e.g., to 30% of its initial value) to reflect changing demographics of infection and improvements in treatment.
          - Although designed primarily for the United States, the model also provides estimates for other countries, where it may have reduced accuracy due to differing data quality and health-system factors.
          - Updates to the model ceased on 5 October 2020, so any emerging trends or subsequent changes in testing, transmission, or IFR are not reflected in its latest estimates.
          - For a full list of assumptions and limitations see [the model "About" page](https://covid19-projections.com/about/#assumptions).

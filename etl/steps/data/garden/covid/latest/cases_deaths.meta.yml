    - The actual death toll from COVID-19 is likely to be higher than the number of confirmed deaths – this is due to limited testing, [poorly functioning death registries](#dod:crvs), challenges in determining the cause of death, and disruptions during the pandemic. The difference between reported confirmed deaths and actual deaths varies between countries.
    - "[Excess mortality](https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid) is a more comprehensive measure of the total mortality impact of the pandemic, compared to the number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths. This is because it captures not only confirmed deaths, but also COVID-19 deaths that were not accurately diagnosed."
    - COVID-19 deaths may be recorded in different ways between countries (e.g., some countries may only count hospital deaths, whilst others also include deaths in homes).
    - Data are presented by the date of reporting rather than symptom onset, and retrospective updates by countries can sometimes lead to sudden spikes or even negative values.
    - WHO encourages weekly reporting to reduce inconsistencies in daily reporting frequencies across countries and help minimize the risk of misinterpreting periods of zero reporting as zero deaths.
    - There are often large differences in the population size between countries. Therefore, to compare deaths between countries, it is more insightful to look at the number of confirmed deaths as a rate per million people.

    - _Confirmed_ cases represent the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections as reported to WHO, but may not capture the true scale of infection due to varying testing strategies, case definitions, and underreporting.
    - Data are presented by date of reporting rather than symptom onset, and retrospective updates or corrections by countries can lead to sudden spikes or negative values.
    - Since WHO relies on Member State reporting, differences in local definitions, testing capacities, and reporting practices can affect international comparisons and trending over time.

    Due to varying protocols and challenges in the attribution of the cause of death, the number of confirmed deaths may not accurately represent the true number of deaths caused by COVID-19.

    This indicator is estimated by normalizing by population. We have used daily population estimates, which leads to changes in the denominator between datapoints from different days. For instance, the denominator for January 1st will be different to the one on January 2nd.

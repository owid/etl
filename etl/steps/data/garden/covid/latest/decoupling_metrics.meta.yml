  title: 'COVID-19: Decoupling of metrics (various sources)'
  description: >-
    By comparing the proportion of confirmed cases that result in hospital admissions, ICU admissions, and deaths, to previous
    waves – when the population was not vaccinated – we can learn something about the protection that vaccination has provided
    against severe outcomes.


    This chart shows one way to do this. It visualizes the main COVID metrics relative to the peak of the last wave. The peak
    of the last wave happened before the population was widely vaccinated. In this representation of the data, if confirmed
    cases increase but hospitalizations and deaths increase to a lesser extent, it will mean that the many reported cases
    are leading to fewer severe forms of the disease, and fewer deaths.


    Differences between countries and between waves may arise from factors such as: the number of vaccine doses administered
    per person; immunity from previous infections; the variants that are dominant within the population; the demographics
    of the population; and the demographics of people who have been vaccinated. For example, countries where the elderly and
    most vulnerable have been vaccinated at higher rates may have fewer severe outcomes.

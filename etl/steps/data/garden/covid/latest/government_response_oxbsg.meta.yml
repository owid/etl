  title: COVID Government Response (OxBSG)
  description: >-
    OxCGRT collects publicly available information on indicators of government response.
    These indicators take policies
    such as school closures, travel bans, etc. and record them on an ordinal scale.
    The remainder is financial indicators,
    such as fiscal or monetary measures.


    OxCGRT measures the variation in governments’ responses using its COVID-19 Government
    Response Stringency Index. This
    composite measure is a simple additive score of nine indicators measured on
    an ordinal scale, rescaled to vary from
    0 to 100. Please note that this measure is for comparative purposes only, and
    should not be interpreted as a rating
    of the appropriateness or effectiveness of a country's response.


    It also includes a 'COVID-19 Containment and Health Response' index which is
    based on the metrics used in the 'Stringency
    Index' plus testing policy, contact tracing, face coverings and vaccine policy.


    The specific policy and response categories are coded as follows:


    School closures:

    0 - No measures

    1 - recommend closing

    2 - Require closing (only some levels or categories,

    e.g. just high school, or just public schools)

    No data - blank


    Workplace closures:

    0 - No measures

    1 - recommend closing (or work from home)

    2 - require closing (or work from home) for some

    description_key:
      - COVAX is an international initiative led by Gavi, CEPI, and WHO to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of a country's wealth.
      - Through the COVAX Facility, self-financing countries pool funds to procure vaccines, while 92 lower-income countries receive free doses supported by donor funding through the Gavi COVAX AMC.
      - Donations to COVAX help scale up vaccine manufacturing capacity early, preventing significant delays or shortages once vaccines receive approval.
      - Ensuring widespread vaccine access underpins the 'no one is safe until everyone is safe' principle, aiming to end the pandemic by reducing disparities in vaccination.

      short_term_tests_per_case:
        title: Daily COVID-19 tests per new confirmed case
        unit: "tests per confirmed case"
        description_short: |-
          The number of tests each day divided by the number of confirmed cases each day. The series is smoothed by averaging daily figures over a rolling 7-day window.
        description_processing: Not all countries report testing data on a daily basis. To generate this series we assume that testing changed equally on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported.

            title: Tests conducted per confirmed case of COVID-19
            subtitle: 7-day rolling average. The number of tests divided by the number of confirmed cases. Comparisons across countries are affected by differences in testing policies and reporting methods.

      cumulative_tests_per_case:
        title: Total COVID-19 tests per confirmed case
        description_short: |-
          The total number of tests to date divided by the total number of confirmed cases. Tests may refer to the number of tests performed or the number of people tested - depending on which is reported by the particular country.
        unit: "tests per confirmed case"

      short_term_positivity_rate:
        title: COVID-19 positivity rate
        description_short: |-
          The daily number of confirmed cases divided by the daily number of tests, expressed as a percentage. Tests may refer to the number of tests performed or the number of people tested - depending on which is reported by the particular country.

            subtitle: 7-day rolling average. The number of confirmed cases divided by the number of tests, expressed as a percentage. Comparisons across countries are affected by differences in testing policies and reporting methods.

      cumulative_positivity_rate:
        title: COVID-19 positivity rate (cumulative)
        description_short: |-
          The total number of confirmed cases to date divided by the total number of tests to date, expressed as a percentage. Tests may refer to the number of tests performed or the number of people tested - depending on which is reported by the particular country.

        description_short: |-
          Boolean value indicating if a country has had more than 100 cased in the last 21 days, has testing data and has more than 5 million population.

          The number of tests each day divided by the number of confirmed cases each day. The series is smoothed by averaging daily figures over a rolling 7-day window.
        description_processing: Not all countries report testing data on a daily basis. To generate this series we assume that testing changed equally on a daily basis over any periods in which no data was reported.

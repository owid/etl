  title: YouGov-Imperial COVID-19 Behavior Tracker, composite variables
  description: >-
    Data constructed from:


    (1) Survey data collected by YouGov in partnership with the Institute of Global
    Health Innovation (IGHI) at Imperial
    College London. YouGov has partnered with the Institute of Global Health Innovation
    (IGHI) at Imperial College London
    to gather global insights on people’s behaviors in response to COVID-19. The
    research will cover 29 countries, interviewing
    around 21,000 people each week.


    It is designed to provide behavioral analysis on how different populations are
    responding to the pandemic, helping public
    health bodies in their efforts to limit the impact of the disease. Anonymized
    respondent level data will be available
    for all public health and academic institutions globally.


    The questions in the survey, led by IGHI, cover data on testing, symptoms, self-isolating
    in response to symptoms and
    the ability and willingness to self-isolate if needed. It also looks at behaviors,
    including going outdoors, working
    outside the home, contact with others, handwashing and the extent of compliance
    with 20 common preventative measures.

    sources. You can download the full

          Monthly share of the population who have not received a COVID-19 vaccine and who neither agree or disagree with
          the statement: "If a COVID-19 vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it." Respondents
          were presented with a 1 to 5 scale, ranging from "Strongly agree" (1) to "Strongly disagree" (5). We consider responses
          of 3 to neither be in agreement or disagreement with the statement.


          This statement was only presented to survey respondents who said they have not received a COVID-19 vaccination.
          To aggregate these responses into a share of a country's population, we multiply the share of respondents who neither
          agree or disagree with the statement by the share of the country's population that is unvaccinated. Data on the
          share of a country's population that is unvaccinated comes from public official sources, collated by Our World in
          Data at https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations.


          Individuals under 18 years of age were not surveyed. As a result, the share of survey respondents who neither agree
          or disagree with the statement is a representative estimate of the share of a country's unvaccinated population
          aged 18 and above who would neither agree or disagree with the statement, but is not necessarily a representative
          estimate of the share of a country's unvaccinated population of all ages who would neither agree or disagree with
          the statement. Nevertheless, we expect any differences to be minor.


          Months containing fewer than 500 survey respondents are excluded.

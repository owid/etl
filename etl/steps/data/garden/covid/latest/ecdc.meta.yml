    Raw data on confirmed cases and deaths for all countries is sourced from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and
    Control (ECDC)](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide).


    Our complete COVID-19 dataset is a collection of the COVID-19 data maintained by *Our World in Data*. **It is updated
    daily** and includes data on confirmed cases, deaths, and testing.


    We have created a new description of all our data sources. You find it at our GitHub repository **[here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/)**.

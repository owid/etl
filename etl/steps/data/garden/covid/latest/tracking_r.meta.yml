        title: Serial interval for Covid-19
        description_short: |-
          Provides a range from 5 to 10 days. An extense discussion on the effect of changing the serial interval can be found on the paper. Recent studies find that estimates of the serial interval for COVID-19 range between 4 and 9 days (Nishiura et al.,2020b;Park et al.,2020;Sanche et al.,2020). Authors suggest using 7 days (the average of the range) as point of reference.

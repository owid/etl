          - "This indicator combines three different datasets: Lindert (2004), OECD (1985), and the OECD Social Expenditure Database (SOCX). We combine the two OECD datasets by using the implicit growth rate from the older series, so we can extend the series back to 1960. We also use the data from Lindert (2004) to extend the series to 1880."

          We extrapolated the data available from the OECD Social Expenditure Database (public, in-cash and in-kind spending, all programs) using the earliest available observation from this dataset and applying the growth rates implied by the OECD (1985) data to obtain a series starting in 1960. These steps are necessary because the data in common years is not exactly the same for the two datasets due to changes in definitions and measurement. Nevertheless, we assume that trends stay the same in both cases.

          We don't transform the data from Lindert (2004), the values are the same as in the original source.

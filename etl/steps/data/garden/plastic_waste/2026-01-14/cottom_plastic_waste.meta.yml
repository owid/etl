        - Plastic Pollution

  text_spot_model_principles: &text_spot_model_principles
    Cottom et al. (2024) developed the [SPOT model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07758-6) model, which first fills gaps in municipal waste data using statistical predictions. It then estimates how plastic flows through the waste system and quantifies the uncertainty in those estimates. The model produces results for around 50,700 municipalities, which are subsequently aggregated to country and regional totals.

  text_scope_exclusions: &text_scope_exclusions
    This data covers plastic that comes from land-based municipal solid waste (everyday waste from households and similar sources). It does not include pollution from making plastic, textiles, sea-based sources (like fishing gear), electronic waste, or plastic that is exported as waste and then lost elsewhere.

  text_msw_definition: &text_msw_definition
    Municipal solid waste is everyday non-hazardous waste from households and other municipal sources such as shops, offices and institutions. It does not include industrial, construction or hazardous waste.

  text_plastic_waste_definition: &text_plastic_waste_definition
    Municipal plastic waste is the plastic fraction of municipal solid waste (for example, packaging and consumer products discarded with household waste).

  text_model_uncertainty: &text_model_uncertainty
    Values are model-based estimates and come with uncertainty. They should be interpreted as approximate estimates rather than exact measurements.

  text_per_capita_calculation: &text_per_capita_calculation
    Per-capita values are calculated by dividing the total annual value by the relevant population (for example, the population of a country, region or income group).

  text_macroplastic_definition: &text_macroplastic_definition
    The data covers macroplastics — physical plastic pieces larger than 5 millimeters.

  text_pollution_definition: &text_pollution_definition
    Plastic pollution is plastic that is no longer contained because it escapes from collection, disposal, or recycling and enters the environment.

  text_plastic_debris_definition: &text_plastic_debris_definition
    Debris pollution is unburned macroplastic items that escape from the waste system into the environment as intact items.

  text_emission_sources: &text_emission_sources
    "Plastic pollution is attributed to five land-based sources: uncollected waste, littering, losses during collection and transport, uncontrolled disposal sites (open dumps), and rejects from sorting and reprocessing."

  text_open_burning_definition: &text_open_burning_definition
   This indicator measures how much macroplastic waste is burned in open, uncontrolled fires.

  text_controlled_vs_uncontrolled: &text_controlled_vs_uncontrolled
    This is different from controlled incineration in engineered facilities, which is counted as managed treatment rather than pollution.

  text_burning_clarification: &text_burning_clarification
    The values refer to the mass of plastic subjected to open burning, not to the gaseous pollutants released by the fires.

  text_total_pollution_definition: &text_total_pollution_definition
    Total plastic pollution is the sum of debris (unburned plastic that escapes into the environment as physical items) and plastic burned in open, uncontrolled fires.

  text_dumpsite_working_face: &text_dumpsite_working_face
    For open dumps, pollution refers to plastic that escapes from exposed waste, not plastic that stays buried in the dump.

  text_properly_managed_definition: &text_properly_managed_definition
    Managed and controlled waste is collected and treated in controlled facilities such as sanitary landfills, engineered incinerators and formal recycling plants.

  text_properly_managed_exclusions: &text_properly_managed_exclusions
    It does not include waste that is left uncollected, dumped in open sites, burned in the open or emitted into the unmanaged environment.

  text_properly_managed_context: &text_properly_managed_context
    These values describe how much municipal waste remains within a controlled system instead of becoming pollution.

  text_share_global_interpretation: &text_share_global_interpretation
    Because they are shares of a global total, they show each country or region's contribution regardless of population size.

  text_collection_coverage_interpretation: &text_collection_coverage_interpretation
    Lower collection coverage is often associated with higher pollution from uncollected waste, because more waste remains outside formal systems.

  text_collection_delivery_interpretation: &text_collection_delivery_interpretation
    Low delivery rates can indicate limited capacity or unreliable service, even where collection services exist.

  text_no_collection_derived: &text_no_collection_derived
    It is derived from the modelled collection coverage and population estimates produced by the [SPOT model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07758-6), which first fills gaps in municipal waste data using statistical predictions, then simulates how plastic flows through waste systems and quantifies uncertainty in those estimates. The model generates results for around 50,700 municipalities, which are then aggregated to country and regional totals.

  desc_key_plastic_pollution_shares_burn: &desc_key_plastic_pollution_shares_burn

  desc_key_collection_coverage: &desc_key_collection_coverage
    - Collection coverage shows the share of municipal waste generation that occurs in areas served by formal collection services.
    - This indicator excludes littering, focusing on waste that would otherwise enter the waste collection system.
    - *text_collection_coverage_interpretation
    - *text_model_uncertainty

  desc_key_collection_delivery: &desc_key_collection_delivery
    - Collection delivery shows the share of generated municipal waste that is actually collected and transported to treatment or disposal facilities.
    - It differs from collection coverage by measuring realised performance, not just whether services are available.
    - *text_collection_delivery_interpretation
    - *text_model_uncertainty

  desc_key_pollution_shares_generation: &desc_key_pollution_shares_generation
    - These indicators show the share of waste generation that follows a specific pathway (expressed as a percentage).
    - For littering, uncollected waste and collection-loss indicators, the numerator is macroplastic pollution and the denominator is municipal plastic waste generation.
    - For open burning (% of generation), the numerator is total municipal solid waste openly burned (all materials) and the denominator is total municipal solid waste generation.

    - *text_model_uncertainty

  desc_key_disposal_shares: &desc_key_disposal_shares
    - These indicators show how waste disposed on land is split between controlled and uncontrolled facilities.
    - Controlled disposal includes sanitary landfills and engineered sites designed to contain waste. Uncontrolled disposal refers to open dumps and similar sites with little or no containment.
    - Higher shares of uncontrolled disposal are often associated with greater risks of plastic pollution and open burning.
    - *text_model_uncertainty

  desc_key_no_collection_count: &desc_key_no_collection_count
    - This indicator counts how many people do not have access to formal municipal waste collection services.

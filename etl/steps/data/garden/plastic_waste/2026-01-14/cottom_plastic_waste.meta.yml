  # Reusable text snippets
  text_msw_definition: &text_msw_definition
    Municipal solid waste is everyday waste from households, shops, offices and similar sources. It does not include industrial, construction or hazardous waste.

  text_msw_methodology: &text_msw_methodology
    These estimates combine measured waste data from cities and towns with machine-learning predictions to fill gaps where data are missing.

  text_model_uncertainty: &text_model_uncertainty
    Values are model-based estimates produced with probabilistic material flow analysis and should be interpreted as estimates rather than exact measurements.

  text_per_capita_calculation: &text_per_capita_calculation
    Per-capita values are calculated by dividing total annual waste by the relevant population, for example the population of a country, region or income group.

  text_per_capita_debris_calculation: &text_per_capita_debris_calculation
    Per-capita values are calculated by dividing total debris emissions by the relevant population, for example the population of a country or region.

  text_per_capita_plastic_calculation: &text_per_capita_plastic_calculation
    Per-capita values are calculated by dividing total plastic emissions by the relevant population, for example the population of a country or region.

  text_macroplastic_definition: &text_macroplastic_definition
    These values refer to macroplastic, meaning plastic pieces larger than 5 millimetres.

  text_plastic_debris_definition: &text_plastic_debris_definition
    Plastic debris emissions are macroplastic items that escape from the waste system into the environment as intact items.

  text_debris_sources: &text_debris_sources
    "In this dataset, debris emissions are estimated from five land-based sources: uncollected waste, littering, losses during collection and transport, uncontrolled disposal sites and rejects from sorting and reprocessing."

  text_spot_model_uncertainty: &text_spot_model_uncertainty
    Values are model-based estimates derived from the SPOT ([Spatio-temporal quantification of plastic pollution origins and transport](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07758-6#MOESM1)) framework and have inherent uncertainty.

  text_open_burning_definition: &text_open_burning_definition
    These indicators measure the mass of plastic waste that is burned in open, uncontrolled fires.

  text_controlled_vs_uncontrolled: &text_controlled_vs_uncontrolled
    This is different from controlled incineration in engineered facilities, which is counted as managed disposal rather than emissions.

  text_burning_clarification: &text_burning_clarification
    The values refer to the mass of plastic subjected to open burning, not to the gaseous pollutants released by the fires.

  text_properly_managed_definition: &text_properly_managed_definition
    Properly managed waste is collected and treated in controlled facilities such as sanitary landfills, engineered incinerators and formal recycling plants.

  text_properly_managed_exclusions: &text_properly_managed_exclusions
    It does not include waste that is left uncollected, dumped in open sites, burned in the open or leaked into the environment.

  text_properly_managed_context: &text_properly_managed_context
    These values show how much municipal waste remains within a managed system instead of becoming pollution.

  text_per_capita_managed_calculation: &text_per_capita_managed_calculation
    Per-capita values are calculated by dividing the total properly managed waste by the relevant population, for example the population of a country or region.

  text_total_emissions_definition: &text_total_emissions_definition
    Total plastic emissions combine debris, which are intact macroplastic items that escape into the environment, and plastic burned in open, uncontrolled fires.

  text_emissions_definition: &text_emissions_definition
    Emissions are defined here as plastic that moves from a managed or mismanaged state into the unmanaged environment, where it is no longer under control.

  text_msw_plastic_only: &text_msw_plastic_only

  # Individual pathway descriptions
  text_litter_pathway: &text_litter_pathway
    This pathway captures plastic waste that is directly discarded into the environment by individuals, rather than being placed in waste collection systems.

  text_uncollected_pathway: &text_uncollected_pathway
    This pathway captures plastic waste that was never collected by formal waste services, often in areas lacking access to waste collection infrastructure.

  text_collection_pathway: &text_collection_pathway
    This pathway captures plastic waste that escapes during the collection and transport process, such as items falling from collection vehicles or blowing away during handling.

  text_disposal_pathway: &text_disposal_pathway
    This pathway captures plastic waste that escapes from uncontrolled disposal sites such as open dumps, where waste is not properly contained.

  text_recycling_pathway: &text_recycling_pathway
    This pathway captures plastic waste that escapes during sorting and recycling operations, including rejected materials and processing losses.

  text_per_capita_litter_calculation: &text_per_capita_litter_calculation

  text_per_capita_uncollected_calculation: &text_per_capita_uncollected_calculation

  desc_key_plastic_emissions_shares: &desc_key_plastic_emissions_shares
    - These indicators show plastic emissions as a percentage of the global total for each country or region.
    - Because they are expressed as a share of global emissions, they show how much each country or region contributes to worldwide plastic pollution, regardless of its population size.
    - Values are based on the same modelled emissions as the other plastic indicators in this dataset.

  desc_key_collection_coverage: &desc_key_collection_coverage
    - Collection coverage shows the share of waste generation that has access to formal collection services.
    - This indicator excludes litter, focusing on waste that should enter the formal waste system.
    - Low collection coverage means many people lack access to waste collection, which is strongly linked to higher plastic emissions from uncollected waste.

  desc_key_collection_delivery: &desc_key_collection_delivery
    - Collection delivery shows the share of generated waste that is actually collected and transported to treatment or disposal facilities.
    - It differs from collection coverage by measuring realised performance, not just whether services are available on paper.
    - Low delivery rates suggest problems with the reliability or capacity of collection systems, even where services officially exist.

  desc_key_emissions_shares_generation: &desc_key_emissions_shares_generation
    - These indicators show emissions from a specific pathway as a percentage of total waste generated.
    - For plastic pathways, both the numerator and denominator refer to plastic waste. For the open burning indicator, they refer to all municipal solid waste burned and generated.
    - "Expressing emissions as a share of generation allows comparisons between places with very different waste volumes: low percentages mean only a small share of waste follows that pathway, while high values point to substantial pollution and health risks."

  desc_key_disposal_shares: &desc_key_disposal_shares
    - These indicators show how waste that is disposed of on land is split between controlled and uncontrolled facilities.
    - Controlled disposal includes sanitary landfills and engineered sites designed to contain waste. Uncontrolled disposal refers to open dumps and similar sites with little or no containment.
    - Higher shares of uncontrolled disposal are associated with more plastic pollution, because waste in open dumps is more likely to escape into the environment or be burned.

  desc_key_no_collection_count: &desc_key_no_collection_count
    - This indicator counts how many people do not have access to formal municipal waste collection services.
    - People without collection typically have to manage their own waste, often by dumping it nearby or burning it, which is a major source of plastic pollution in many low- and middle-income countries.

  desc_key_no_collection_share: &desc_key_no_collection_share
    - This indicator shows the share of the population without access to formal municipal waste collection services.
    - People without collection typically have to manage their own waste, often by dumping it nearby or burning it, which is a major source of plastic pollution in many low- and middle-income countries.

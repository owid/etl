definitions:
  international_aviation_description_key: &international_aviation_description_key
    - Emissions from international aviation and shipping are not included in any country or region's emissions. They are only included in the global total emissions.
  consumption_emissions_description_key: &consumption_emissions_description_key
    - Consumption-based emissions attribute the emissions generated in the production of goods and services according to where they were _consumed_, rather than where they were _produced_.
    - "The data is calculated by adjusting 'production-based' emissions (emissions produced domestically) for trade: Consumption-based emissions equals production-based emissions, _minus_ emissions embedded in exports, _plus_ emissions embedded in imports."
    - If a country's consumption-based emissions are higher than its production emissions it is a net importer of carbon dioxide. If its consumption-based emissions are lower, then it is a net exporter.
    - Consumption-based emissions are not available for all countries because not all countries have sufficient, high-quality trade data. But those without complete data are a small fraction (3%) of the global total.
    - This data measures carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from fossil fuels and industry and does not include emissions from land use change, deforestation, soils, or vegetation.
  per_capita_description_key: &per_capita_description_key
    - Per capita emissions represent the emissions of an average person in a country or region - they are total emissions divided by population.

        - Data on global emissions has been converted from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.
        - Emissions from the Kuwaiti oil fires in 1991 have been included as part of Kuwait's emissions for that year.
        - Country's share of the global population is calculated using our population dataset, based on [different sources](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources).
        - Each country's share of global CO₂ emissions from flaring has been calculated using global CO₂ emissions from flaring provided in the Global Carbon Budget dataset.

        title: Maximum ozone hole area
        short_unit: "km²"
        unit: "square kilometers"
        description_short: |
          The yearly maximum daily ozone hole area.
        description_key:
          - The ozone hole area is determined from total ozone satellite measurements. It is defined to be that region of ozone values below 220 Dobson Units (DU) located south of 40°S. Values below 220 DU represent anthropogenic ozone losses over Antarctica.

      min_hole_concentration:
        title: Minimum daily concentration
        short_unit: "DU"
        unit: "Dobson Units (DU)"
        description_short: |
          The yearly minimum daily minimum ozone.

        description_key:
          - The minimum ozone is found from total ozone satellite measurements south of 40°S. No interpolation of missing values is performed. This means that the actual minimum value on a day may be estimated too high, especially in the polar night region.

          Ozone hole area mean (07 September - 13 October) for each year.

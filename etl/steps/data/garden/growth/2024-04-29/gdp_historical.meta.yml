      The data presented here from 1820 onwards is from Maddison Project Database. Data before 1820 is constructed using the 1820 Maddison Project Database observation and applying the growth rates implied by the Maddison Database. These steps are necessary because the two datasets estimate GDP with different prices.

      The adjusted results before 1820 have been rounded to address uncertainty in the underlying data. GDP data is rounded to the nearest million, and GDP is rounded to the nearest hundred.

  description_adjustment: This data is adjusted for inflation and for differences in the cost of living between countries.
  description_unit_merge: This data is expressed in [international-$](#dod:int_dollar_abbreviation) at 2011 prices, merging data from Maddison Project Database, backwards extended with growth rates from Maddison Database.

      This indicator describes how the levels of major greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere have changed over geological time and in recent years. Changes in atmospheric GHGs, in part caused by human activities, affect the amount of energy held in the Earth-atmosphere system and thus affect the Earth's climate. This indicator is highly relevant to climate change because greenhouse gases from human activities are the primary driver of observed climate change since the mid-20th century (IPCC, 2021).

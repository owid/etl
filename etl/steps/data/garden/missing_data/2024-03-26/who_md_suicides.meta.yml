    description_processing: First, we organized countries into groups based on geographical regions and income levels, aligning with World Bank classifications. To quantify data completeness, we identified entries with missing information in the indicator. For each grouping, we calculated the percentage of countries with missing data, thus mapping out the distribution of data gaps across different regions and income levels.

  description_key: Missing data on annual death rate from self-inflicted injuries per 100,000 people, based on the [underlying cause](#dod:underlying-cause-of-death) listed on death certificates. To allow for comparisons between countries and over time, this metric is [age-standardized](#dod:age_standardized).

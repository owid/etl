  description: |
    All data prior to 1985 (and prior to 1965 in the case of renewables), is sourced from [the Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES), published by the UK's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/electricity-chapter-5-digest-of-united-kingdom-energy-statistics-dukes).

    All other data is sourced from the [BP's Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html) and [Ember's Yearly Electricity Data](https://ember-climate.org/data-catalogue/yearly-electricity-data/). Where data from BP is available for a given year, we rely on it as the primary source. We then supplement this with data from Ember where data from BP is not available.

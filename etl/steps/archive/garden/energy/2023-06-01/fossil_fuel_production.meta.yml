dataset:
  title: Fossil fuel production (BP & Shift, 2023b)
  description: |
    This dataset on fossil fuel production is generated by combining the latest data from [the BP Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html) and [The Shift Dataportal](https://www.theshiftdataportal.org/energy).

    BP provide fossil fuel production data from 1965 onwards (and crude prices from 1861 onwards). The Shift Dataportal provides long-term data from 1900, but only extends to 2016.

    To maintain consistency with the energy datasets on Our World in Data, we have taken BP data as preference - meaning if BP provides data for the given country and year, this is used. Where data is not available from BP for a given country, or pre-1965 we rely on data from Shift.

    We have converted primary production in exajoules to terawatt-hours using the conversion factor: 1,000,000 / 3,600 ~ 278.

    Production per capita has been calculated using a population dataset that is built and maintained by Our World in Data, based on [different sources](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources).

      The Global Carbon Budget dataset is available [here](https://www.icos-cp.eu/science-and-impact/global-carbon-budget/2021) and [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5569235).

      Variables include each country, region and World Bank income group's share of the global population; production-based (territorial); and consumption-based (trade-adjusted) carbon dioxide emissions.

      This was calculated by Our World in Data based on CO₂ figures produced by the Global Carbon Project. This is given as production (territorial) emissions in addition to trade-adjusted consumption-based emissions. Consumption-based emissions are national or regional emissions which have been adjusted for trade (i.e. territorial/production emissions minus emissions embedded in exports, plus emissions embedded in imports). If a country's consumption-based emissions are higher than its production emissions it is a net importer of carbon dioxide.

      Note that consumption-based emissions are not available for all countries; although those without complete data are a small fraction (3%) of the global total. Each country's share of world emissions are based on the share of the global total minus categories termed 'bunkers' and 'statistical differences' (which include cross-boundary emissions such as international travel and shipping.

      Calculation of each country's share of the global population is calculated using our population dataset, based on [different sources](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources)).

      Data on global emissions has been converted by Our World in Data from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664.

    According to Farmer & Lafond (2016), the data are mostly taken from the Santa-Fe [Performance Curve Database](https://pcdb.santafe.edu/). The database has been constructed from personal communications and from [Colpier and Cornland (2002)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0095), [Goldemberg et al.

The data on photovoltaic prices has been collected from public releases of Strategies Unlimited, Navigant and SPV Market Research. The data on nuclear energy is from [Koomey and Hultman (2007)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0165) and [Cooper (2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0100). The DNA sequencing data is from [Wetterstrand (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699#bib0290) (cost per human-size genome), and for each year the last available month (September for 2001-2002 and October afterwards) was taken and corrected for inflation using the US GDP deflator.

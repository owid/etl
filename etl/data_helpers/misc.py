"""General data tools.

Use this module with caution. Functions added here are half-way their final destination: owid-datautils.

When working on a specific project, it is often the case that we may identify functions that can be useful for other projects. These functions
should probably be moved to owid-datautils. However this can be time consuming at the time we are working on the project. Therefore:

- By adding them here we make them available for other projects.
- We have these functions in one place if we ever wanted to move them to owid-datautils.
- Prior to moving them to owid-datautils, we can test and discuss them.

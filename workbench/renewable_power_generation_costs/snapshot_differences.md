## Content Structure Impact

### Sheet Changes Summary
- **54 NEW sheets**: Including new trajectory analyses, regional breakdowns, and enabling technologies data
- **45 REMOVED sheets**: Mostly older format sheets and storage-specific content
- **86 COMMON sheets**: Core data sheets maintained with updated data

### Data Format Changes
- Many figures now include 2022-2024 trajectory data instead of full historical series
- Enhanced regional and country-specific breakdowns
- New cost and performance trajectory analyses

## Summary

### Key Changes
1. **Significantly expanded dataset** (file size doubled)
2. **Extended time coverage** with 2024 data across all major technologies
3. **Reorganized report structure** with new "Enabling technologies" focus
4. **Enhanced granular data** with more country and regional breakdowns
5. **Updated metadata** reflecting the 2025 publication covering 2024 data

### Impact Assessment
The new 2025-08-22 version represents a major update with doubled file size, extended time series through 2024, restructured content organization (moving from storage focus to enabling technologies), and significantly enhanced country/regional data coverage. The core renewable technology data (solar, wind, hydro, etc.) has been updated with 2024 values and new trajectory analyses.

### Recommendation
This is a significant update that extends the time series and adds substantial new data. The ETL pipeline will need to be updated to handle the new data structure and extended time coverage.

# Dataset Update

### Create PR and update steps

1. First create a draft PR using `etl pr` command with a proper branch name and `data` category
2. Use the `etl update snapshot://` command with `--include-usages` to copy the dataset to the new version. For instance
   ```bash
   etl update snapshot://#$ARGUMENTS --include-usages
   ```
3. Run snapshot with `etls`, e.g. `etls #$ARGUMENTS`
4. Run `etlr` with `--grapher` to execute the updated steps. It's ok if it fails, don't fix it!
5. Commit changes and push to the PR branch
6. Ask user for review and permission to continue with fixing steps

### Fix steps

1. If `etlr` failed, investigate the error and try to fix it.
2. Update the metadata YAML file to match the new column structure if necessary.
3. Summarise the changes in the PR description.

### Common issues when data structure changes

- **Column name changes**: If columns are renamed/split (e.g., single cost â†’ local currency + PPP), update:
  - Python code references in garden step
  - Garden metadata YAML (`food_prices_for_nutrition.meta.yml`)
  - Grapher metadata YAML (if exists)
- **Index issues**: Check for unwanted `index` columns from `reset_index()` - ensure proper indexing with `tb.format(["country", "year"])`
- **Metadata validation**: Use error messages as guide - they show exactly which variables to add/remove from YAML files
- **Snapshot metadata**: Check if version info needs updating in `.dvc` file:
  - Update `version_producer`, `date_published`, and years in citations if newer version available
  - Keep your own `date_accessed` but align version info with the actual data

## Indicator Upgrader

The indicator upgrader tool helps systematically update charts when datasets are replaced with new versions. It maps indicators from old datasets to new datasets and updates all affected charts automatically.

### Finding Dataset Pairs

First, identify the old and new dataset versions using their shortName:

```sql
mysql -h staging-site-data-wb-foodprices-nutrition -u owid --port 3306 -D owid -e "SELECT id, catalogPath, name FROM datasets WHERE shortName = 'dataset_short_name' AND NOT isArchived ORDER BY id;"
```

This will show all versions of the dataset with their IDs and catalog paths.

### Analyzing Indicator Mappings

Use this SQL to find perfect matches and unmapped indicators between datasets:

```sql
mysql -h staging-site-data-wb-foodprices-nutrition -u owid --port 3306 -D owid -e "
SELECT
    v_new.id AS new_id,
    v_old.id AS old_id,
    COALESCE(v_new.name, v_old.name) AS title
FROM
    (SELECT DISTINCT v.id, v.name
     FROM variables v
     INNER JOIN chart_dimensions cd ON v.id = cd.variableId
     WHERE v.datasetId = [NEW_DATASET_ID]) v_new
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT v.id, v.name
     FROM variables v
     WHERE v.datasetId = [OLD_DATASET_ID]) v_old
ON v_new.name = v_old.name

UNION

SELECT
    v_new.id AS new_id,
    v_old.id AS old_id,
    COALESCE(v_new.name, v_old.name) AS title
FROM
    (SELECT v.id, v.name
     FROM variables v
     WHERE v.datasetId = [OLD_DATASET_ID]) v_old
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT DISTINCT v.id, v.name
     FROM variables v
     INNER JOIN chart_dimensions cd ON v.id = cd.variableId
     WHERE v.datasetId = [NEW_DATASET_ID]) v_new
ON v_old.name = v_new.name
WHERE v_new.id IS NULL

ORDER BY title;
"
```

Replace `[NEW_DATASET_ID]` and `[OLD_DATASET_ID]` with actual dataset IDs.

### Interpreting Results

The query results show:
- **Perfect matches**: Rows where both `new_id` and `old_id` are not NULL
- **Unmapped new indicators**: Rows where `old_id` is NULL (new indicators used in charts with no old counterpart)
- **Unused old indicators**: Rows where `new_id` is NULL (old indicators not used in current charts)

### Finding Manual Mappings

For unmapped new indicators, analyze the titles manually to find conceptual matches:

- Look for similar concepts with different wording (e.g., "share" vs "percentage", "cost" vs "price")
- Consider unit changes (e.g., "number of people" vs "share of population")
- Check for renamed categories (e.g., "animal-source foods" vs "animal-sourced foods")
- Match by subject matter even if exact phrasing differs

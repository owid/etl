description: Add a scatter view (with GDP per capita on x) to existing OWID charts via the admin API, mirroring the admin UI's "Add scatter type" defaults. Trigger when the user pastes a table with columns `chart_admin_url`, `target_chart_admin_url`, `gdp_source`.

# add-gdp-scatter

Bulk-add a scatter view to a set of OWID charts, with the same defaults the admin UI's `applyDefaultsForScatter` applies — plus extra parity checks against a reference scatter chart.

## When to invoke

The user pastes (TSV or CSV) a table like:

```
chart_admin_url	target_chart_admin_url	gdp_source
https://admin.owid.io/admin/charts/1035/edit	https://admin.owid.io/admin/charts/7842/edit	Maddison Project Database
https://admin.owid.io/admin/charts/6305/edit	https://admin.owid.io/admin/charts/6918/edit	World Bank
```

- `chart_admin_url` — the existing reference scatter chart used as the source of parity hints (yAxis log, y `display.name`, color/size override, tolerance, exclusions).
- `target_chart_admin_url` — the chart the user wants to gain a scatter view.
- `gdp_source` — one of (case-insensitive, substring matches accepted):
  - `World Bank` / `WDI` → variableId `1204826`
  - `Maddison` / `Maddison Project Database` → `900793`
  - `PWT` / `Penn World Table` → `1108541`

The admin host that gets written to is `OWID_ENV.admin_api`, which auto-resolves to `staging-site-<branch>` on a feature branch. Confirm the branch before running.

## Pre-flight: GDP version check

Before processing any rows, the script queries `variables` for the latest id matching each canonical GDP-per-capita `catalogPath` pattern (`worldbank_wdi/.../ny_gdp_pcap_pp_kd`, `ggdc/.../maddison_project_database#gdp_per_capita`, `ggdc/.../penn_world_table#rgdpo_pc`). If the latest id differs from the one hardcoded in `GDP_SOURCES`, a `WARN` is printed at the top of stdout with the newer id and catalogPath. The script does NOT auto-switch — update `GDP_SOURCES` (and the `feedback_scatter_gdp_picker` memory) deliberately if the new version is the one we want.

## What the script does (per row)

Mirrors the admin's `applyDefaultsForScatter` and the extra moves we agreed on:

1. Adds `ScatterPlot` to `chartTypes`, preserving existing tabs. Seeds the schema default `[LineChart, DiscreteBar]` when `chartTypes` is unset.
2. Appends x (the chosen GDP variable), color, size dimensions if absent. **If the source scatter uses a non-default color/size variable** (e.g. World Bank income groups for color, or a historical population series for size), the source's variableId is used on the target instead of the admin defaults `CONTINENTS_ID=900801` / `POPULATION_ID=953899`. **If the source has no `size` dim at all**, the target also gets none — the script will not add a default population sizing if the curator deliberately omitted it.
3. Sets `matchingEntitiesOnly: true`.
4. Sets `xAxis` to `scaleType: log` + `canChangeScaleType: true`.
5. **Mirrors source `yAxis.scaleType: log`** when the source uses it.
6. **Mirrors source's manually-set y `display.name`** when present.
7. Emits warnings (no action) for:
   - Target has no `selectedEntityNames` — line/bar/slope views will fall back to Grapher defaults.
   - Source `excludedEntityNames` — would apply across all views, not just scatter.
   - GDP coverage mismatch — if y-indicator's earliest year predates the chosen GDP's coverage (WDI≈1990, PWT≈1950, Maddison≈year 1), suggest a deeper-history alternative.
   - Few entities on default scatter view — counts entities with both a y- and an x-value within tolerance at the default time; if fewer than ~15 AND source uses higher tolerance, recommends bumping target's y `display.tolerance`.

Push uses `apps.chart_sync.admin_api.AdminAPI.update_chart(id, cfg)`.

## Workflow

1. **Parse the pasted table** into a JSON list, one object per row with keys `chart_admin_url`, `target_chart_admin_url`, `gdp_source`. Strip the header. Accept tab- or comma- separated.

2. **Run the script**, piping the JSON via stdin:

   ```bash
   echo '<JSON>' | .venv/bin/python .claude/skills/add-gdp-scatter/scripts/apply_scatter_defaults.py
   ```

   Output: two stdout tables.

   - **PER-ROW ACTIONS** — `chart`, `src`, `gdp_source`, `status`, `notes`. Statuses: `OK`, `SKIPPED` (e.g. stacked-family chart), `FAIL`, `ERR_PUT`, `ERROR`.
   - **Y-DIM DISPLAY NAMES** — `chart`, `varId`, manual `display.name` (on chart), ETL `display.name` (from `variables.display`), catalog `variable.name`. Only populated for `OK` rows.

3. **Show both tables to the user** verbatim (or formatted as markdown).

4. **Follow up on display names.** Where a target ended up with a manual `display.name` but the ETL variable already defines a reasonable one (or `variable.name` is clean), use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user pick which manual overrides to drop. Then run a small inline Python block to delete the `name` key from `display` on each chosen chart (preserving `unit`/`shortUnit`/etc.), via the same `AdminAPI.update_chart` flow.

## Edge cases

- **Stacked-family chartTypes** (`StackedArea` / `StackedBar` / `StackedDiscreteBar`) without any line-family entry → `SKIPPED`. The user must redesign the chart manually. (Example from session: chart 3547.)
- **Target already has `x`/`color`/`size`** → leave it, like the admin's `if (!hasX)` does. The script will not overwrite an existing dimension.
- **Source has `excludedEntityNames`** → warning only. Exclusions on the target would also hide those entities from line/bar/map views, which is rarely intended.
- **GDP coverage mismatch** → warning only; the user picks per chart whether to switch sources.
- **Sparse scatter view** → warning only; tolerance affects all views, not just scatter.

## What this skill explicitly does NOT do

- Does not add the canonical GDP footnote (`note: "GDP per capita is expressed in [international-$]…"`). Request separately if you want it.
- Does not apply source `excludedEntityNames`.
- Does not adjust `selectedEntityNames`, `originUrl`, `subtitle`, `title`, or `note`.
- Does not push to production — only to whatever environment `OWID_ENV` resolves to.

## Verifying after a run

- Open `OWID_ENV.chart_site(slug)` for one of the targets and switch to the Scatter tab.
- Re-run the same input. The script is idempotent — all changes are guarded by "if absent" / "if not equal" checks; a second run should print `OK` with empty / minimal notes.

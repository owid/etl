      This data is collected by the Our World in Data team from official reports.

      You can find further details in our post on COVID-19 testing, including:

      - Our checklist of questions to understand testing data (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#our-checklist-for-covid-19-testing-data)
      - Information on geographical and temporal coverage (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#which-countries-do-we-have-testing-data-for)
      - detailed country-by-country source information (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing#source-information-country-by-country).

      On 23 June 2022, we stopped adding new datapoints to our COVID-19 testing dataset. You can read more at https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/discussions/2667.

    title: COVID-19, Switzerland and Liechtenstein
    description: |-
      The Federal Office of Public Health publishes data on mortality by vaccination status for Switzerland and Liechtenstein, broken down by age groups.

      The information on incidence is per 100,000 population, with the corresponding vaccination status of "fully vaccinated" and "not vaccinated".

      The mortality rate for the "All ages" group is age-standardized by Our World in Data, using single-year age estimates from the 2022 revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects for Chile. Rates for specific age groups are calculated as crude incidence rates.

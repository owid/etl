    title: Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)
    description: |-
      The Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) collected information on which pandemic response measures were enacted by governments, and when. During the pandemic this helped decision-makers and citizens understand governmental responses in a consistent way, aiding efforts to fight the pandemic. Now that covid-19 is no longer designated a public health emergency of international concern, the data can be used for research purposes and to prepare for future pandemics.

      The OxCGRT systematically collected information on several different common policy responses governments took over 2020, 2021, and 2022, recorded these policies on a scale to reflect the extent of government action, and aggregates these scores into a suite of policy indices. We also collected differentiated policies data where different policies apply to people who were vaccinated and non-vaccinated.

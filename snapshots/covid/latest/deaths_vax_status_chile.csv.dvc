    title: COVID-19, Incidencia de casos según estado de vacunación, grupo de edad, y semana epidemiológica (Chile)
    description: |-
      Incidence of deaths according to vaccination status, age group, and epidemiological week.

      Vaccination status is classified as "Fully vaccinated" for those people who have received two doses and more than 14 days have passed since their second dose, or have received a vaccine from a vaccination protocol that includes only a single dose and more than 28 days have elapsed since inoculation. This variable takes the value "Unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated" if people do not have a complete vaccination schedule.

      The mortality rate corresponds to the incidence rate of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants for the age group, corresponding vaccination status and corresponding epidemiological week.

      The mortality rate for the "All ages" group is age-standardized by Our World in Data, using single-year age estimates from the 2022 revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects for Chile. Rates for specific age groups are calculated as crude incidence rates.

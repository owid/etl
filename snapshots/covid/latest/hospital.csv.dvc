      Our hospital & ICU data is collected from official sources and collated by Our World in Data.

      On 13 August 2023, we stopped adding new datapoints to our COVID-19 hospitalisation dataset.

We will always indicate the original source of the data in our database, and you should always check the license of any such third-party data before use.

    title: Episodes of Regime Transformation
    description: |-
      This dataset captures 680 unique episodes of regime transformation (ERT) from 1900 to 2019. 

      These data provide novel insights into regime change over the past 120 years, illustrating the value of developing a unified framework for studying regime transformation. Such transformations, while meaningfully altering the qualities of the regime, only produce a regime transition about 32% of the time. The majority of episodes either end before a transition takes place or do not have the potential for such a transition (i.e. constituted further democratization in democratic regimes or further autocratization in autocratic regimes).

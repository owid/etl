      The Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) project publishes data and research on democracy and human rights.

      It acknowledges that democracy can be characterized differently and measures electoral, liberal, participatory, deliberative, and egalitarian characterizations of democracy.

      The project relies on evaluations by around 3,500 country experts and supplementary work by its researchers to assess political institutions and the protection of rights.

      The project is managed by the V-Dem Institute, based at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.

      This snapshot contains all 531 V-Dem indicators and 245 indices + 60 other indicators from other data sources.

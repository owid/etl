    title: Democratic Mood
    description: |-
      Democratic mood measures the extent to which the public of a given country supports a democratic political system and opposes any autocratic alternatives. In contrast to satisfaction with democracy, democratic mood captures principled support for democracy. It is measured by applying a Bayesian latent variable model to aggregated survey data from a wide variety of cross-national survey projects. The latest update provides estimates for 141 countries, with estimates beginning in 1988 (for some cases) and ranging until 2020.

      The Bayesian model is developed and described in this article (http://doi.org/10.1017/pan.2018.32). The mood estimates are extended and applied in several additional articles (https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12452, https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055419000558, https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140211036042). This choropleth shows democratic mood in 2020.

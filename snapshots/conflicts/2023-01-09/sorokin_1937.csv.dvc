    What years and countries are covered? 12th-20th century, 11 European countries
      
      - "We have taken almost all the known wars of Greece, Rome, Austria, Germany,
    England, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Russia, and 
      Poland and Lithuania from the periods indicated in the subsequent tables (Chapter
    Ten and Eleven) to the present time, or, in the case of 
      Greece and Rome, to the loss of Greek independence and to the so-called "end
    of the Western Roman Empire," respectively" (Sorokin 1937: 283).
      
      - "for Greece, for Rome, and for nine other European countries" (Sorokin 1937:
    286).
      
      - "From the twelfth to the twentieth century" (Sorokin 1937: 286).
      
      - 976 for France to 1925 (Sorokin 1937: 306-307).


    Which conflicts are covered? Wars


    Which deaths and casualties are covered? Direct military casualties

      - Casualties, military, direct: "This study deals precisely with these three
    quantitative elements of war: the strength of the army, 
      the number of casualties (killed and wounded), and the duration of each of the
    wars studied. No other aspect of the war phenomena is 
      studied, not the economic losses, nor the morbidity and mortality of the civilian
    population, nor anything else" (Sorokin 1937: 282).
      
      - "general losses up to 47,000 [...] but mainly from sickness, therefore not
    included" (Sorokin 1937: 552).
      
      - Casualties are sometimes estimated based on army sizes and war duration: "Likewise,
    the total number of the casualties in a given war means 
      the typical per cent of the casualties in regard to the strength of the army
    multiplied by the number of years during which the war lasted" 
      (Sorokin 1937: 284).
      
      - War casualties sometimes estimated using annual casualties: "the total number
    of the casualties for each given war is obtained, either by 
      multiplication of the typical per cent of the casualties by the number of years,
    or by putting down the actual data which exist in regard 
      to this item for a given war as a whole" (Sorokin 1937: 284).
      
      - Data quality is rough: "This means that the figures given for each period
    are aimed not so much to lay down the actual number of the 
      mobilized or killed and wounded as to obtain a rough measuring device to see
    the comparative increase or de- crease of war from period 
      to period" (Sorokin 1937: 285).


    How did he construct the data?

      - "The actual data are taken from authoritative historical sources, often ably
    summarized and elaborated by various special historical 
      works like the often-quoted works of Delbruck, Bodart, and various encyclopedias
    of war and military science" (Sorokin 1937: 285).


    How did we construct our spreadsheet?

      - We accessed the book, the relevant methodological section starts on page
    282, the detailed descriptions of wars and deaths starts on 
      page 543.

      - We extracted deaths and casualties from Sorokin's numbers on which participant
    suffered which losses during any given conflict; Sorokin 
      often does not provide estimates for all participants of a given conflict.

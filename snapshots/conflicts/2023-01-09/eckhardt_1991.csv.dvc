    What years and countries are covered? 1500 – 1990.


    Which conflicts are covered? War, domestic or international, involving at least
    one state.

      - Threshold for a war: "War—any armed conflict involving one or more governments
    and causing the death of 1,000 or more people per year" 
      (Eckhardt 1991: 25).

      - "Location refer to country which was principal battleground, except for two
    World Wars for which location refers to participating country" 
      (Eckhardt 1991: 25).

      - Also included: "Intervention—overt military action by foreign forces, at the
    invitation of the government in power" (Eckhardt 1991: 25).

      - Also included: "Invasion—armed attack by foreign country, including air attack
    without land invasion" (Eckhardt 1991: 25).


    Which deaths and casualties are covered? Deaths; total, military, or civilian;

      
      - "War-Related Deaths" (Eckhardt 1991: 22).
      
      - "Civilian [—] Military [—] Total" (Eckhardt 1991: 22).
      
      - "Incomplete; breakdown of civilian and military deaths not available in all
    cases" (Eckhardt 1991: 25).
      
      - "World War area-wide deaths are in addition to those which could be located
    by country, and are shown under the country of origin" 
      (Eckhardt 1991: 25).


    How did we construct it?

      - We extracted conflicts as well as deaths and casualties from the list in this
    book.
      - There seems to be an affordable used edition available in the UK that we could
    buy if we wanted more information; alternatively, 
      this book by Eckhardt may have more details in chapter 9.

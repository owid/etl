    What years and countries are covered? 1740–1974, worldwide

      - "List of all major armed conflicts – domestic and international – for the
    period 1740 - 1974" (Bouthoul et al. 1978: 83)


    Which conflicts are covered?

      - Major armed conflicts, domestic and international.

      - "Only those conflicts were included which satisfied at least one of the following
    six quantitative criteria and could 
      therefore be considered as 'major armed conflicts', wars and revolutions being
    the most representative ones." (Bouthoul et al. 1978: 83).

      - 'Major': more than one state, affected a large area, lasted longer than one
    year, killed more than 1,000, or had important results,
      such as regime change or independence; "Those six criteria were: a. undertaken
    by more than one state, b. Affected a space larger 
      than one province or a capital, c. lasted longer than one year, d. Was of great
    intensity (more than 1,000 killed)[...], e. Had important 
      internal results (secession or regime change), f. Had important international
    results (annexation or independence, emergence or 
      disappearance of a state" (Bouthoul et al. 1978: 83).

      - "The list thus includes the following types of conflicts: foreign and civil
    wars, occupations by force (e.g. Austria, 1938), 
      military penetrations, revolutions, uprisings and insurrections, massacres and
    genocide, and other violent troubles with important 
      consequences." (Bouthoul et al. 1978: 83-84).

      - "Conflicts preceded by an asterisk are classified as "inter-state" conflicts
    in the authors' investigation." (Bouthoul et al. 1978: 84).


    Which deaths and casualties are covered?

      - Deaths; military and civilian combined; direct and indirect combined

      - "Number of killed, military and civilian, on account of the conflict (operations,
    massacres, epidemies and famines directly linked to the 
      conflict) (order of magnitude, e.g. 60,000). In view of the difficulty of obtaining
    precise figures, the ones given indicate orders of magnitude" 
      (Bouthoul et al. 1978: 84).

    How did we construct our source spreadsheet?

      - We identified conflicts as well as deaths from the list in their article.

      - We excluded conflicts without deaths.

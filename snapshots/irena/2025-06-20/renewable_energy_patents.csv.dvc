      Data on renewable energy patents.
      This dataset provides comprehensive, but by no means exhaustive information on patents filed for renewable energy worldwide.
      Data for the most recent years are not complete due to a lag between the filing date and the time at which the patents are officially published.
      Further information can be found on [IRENA INSPIRE](https://inspire.irena.org/).

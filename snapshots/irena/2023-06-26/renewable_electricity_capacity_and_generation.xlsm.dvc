  description: |
    IRENA publishes detailed statistics on renewable energy capacity, power generation and renewable energy balances. This data is collected directly from members using the IRENA Renewable Energy Statistics questionnaire and is also supplemented by desk research where official statistics are not available.

    Some technologies include others, following this schema:

    Total renewable energy
      1. Hydropower
          1.1 Renewable hydropower
          1.2 Pumped storage *
      2. Marine
      3. Wind
          3.1 Onshore wind energy
          3.2 Offshore wind energy
      4. Solar
          4.1 Solar photovoltaic
          4.2 Concentrated solar power
      5. Bioenergy
          5.1 Solid biofuels
              5.1.1 Bagasse
              5.1.2 Renewable municipal waste
              5.1.3 Other solid biofuels
          5.2 Liquid biofuels
          5.3 Biogas
      6. Geothermal

    * Pumped storage is included under the "Hydropower" category but not in the "Total renewable energy". Generation from mixed plants is split between hydropower and pumped storage as appropriate.

    title: Tree Cover Loss by Dominant Driver
    description: |-
      Shows a time-series of tree cover loss by dominant driver for the time period 2001-2023, the dominant driver of tree cover loss from 2001-2023 using the following five categories:

      - Commodity-driven deforestation: Large-scale deforestation linked primarily to commercial agricultural expansion.

      - Shifting agriculture: Temporary loss or permanent deforestation due to small- and medium-scale agriculture.

      - Forestry: Temporary loss from plantation and natural forest harvesting, with some deforestation of primary forests.

      - Wildfire: Temporary loss, does not include fire clearing for agriculture.

      - Urbanization: Deforestation for expansion of urban centers.

      The commodity-driven deforestation and urbanization categories represent permanent deforestation, while tree cover usually regrows in the other categories.

    description: >-
      A dataset describing the global warming response to national emissions CO2, CH4 and N2O from fossil and land use sources
      during 1851-2021.


      National CO2 emissions data are collated from the Global Carbon Project (Andrew and Peters, 2022; Friedlingstein et
      al., 2022).


      National CH4 and N2O emissions data are collated from PRIMAP-hist (HISTTP) (Gütschow et al., 2022).


      We construct a time series of cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions for each country, gas, and emissions source (fossil
      or land use). Emissions of CH4 and N2O emissions are related to cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions using the Global
      Warming Potential (GWP*) approach, with best-estimates of the coefficients taken from the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al.,
      2021).


      Warming in response to cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions is estimated using the transient climate response to cumulative
      carbon emissions (TCRE) approach, with best-estimate value of TCRE taken from the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al., 2021, Canadell
      et al., 2021). 'Warming' is specifically the change in global mean surface temperature (GMST).


      The data files provide emissions, cumulative emissions and the GMST response by country, gas (CO2, CH4, N2O or 3-GHG
      total) and source (fossil emissions, land use emissions or the total).

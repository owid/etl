    title: 'World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP): Percentiles'
    description: |-
      The Poverty and Inequality Platform: Percentiles database reports 100 points ranked according to the consumption or income distributions for country-year survey data available in the World Bankâ€™s Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP). There are, as of March 26, 2024, a total of 2,367 country-survey-year data points, which include 2,201 distributions based on microdata or binned data, and 166 based on grouped data. For the grouped data, the percentiles are derived by fitting a parametric Lorenz distribution following Datt (1998). For ease of communication, all distributions are referred to as survey data henceforth, and the welfare variable is referred to as income.

      We modified the original files available in [World Bank's Databank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0063646/_poverty_and_inequality_platform_pip_percentiles) to include distributions from missing countries and regions with data available in PIP's API.

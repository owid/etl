    title: 'World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP): Percentiles'
    description: |-
      The Poverty and Inequality Platform: Percentiles database reports 100 points ranked according to the consumption or income distributions for country-year survey data available in the World Bankâ€™s Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP). There are, as of September 19, 2024, a total of 2,456 country-survey-year data points, which include 2,274 distributions based on microdata, binned data, or imputed/synthetic data, and 182 based on grouped data. For the grouped data, the percentiles are derived by fitting a parametric Lorenz distribution following Datt (1998). For ease of communication, all distributions are referred to as survey data henceforth, and the welfare variable is referred to as income.

      We modified the original files available in [World Bank's Databank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0063646/_poverty_and_inequality_platform_pip_percentiles) to include distributions from regions with data available in PIP's API.

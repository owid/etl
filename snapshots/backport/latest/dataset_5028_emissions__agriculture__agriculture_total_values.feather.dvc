  name: 'Emissions - Agriculture: Agriculture Total'
  description: Agriculture Total contains all the emissions produced in the different
    agricultural emissions sub-domains (enteric fermentation, manure management, rice
    cultivation, synthetic fertilizers, manure applied to soils, manure left on pastures,
    crop residues, cultivation of organic soils,  burning of crop residues, burning
    of savanna, energy use), providing a picture of the contribution to the total
    amount of GHG emissions from agriculture. GHG emissions from agriculture consist
    of non-CO2 gases, namely methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), produced by crop
    and livestock production and management activities.  The FAOSTAT emissions database
    is computed following Tier 1 IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories
    (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html). GHG emissions are
    provided by country, regions and special groups, with global coverage, relative
    to the period 1961-present (with annual updates) and with projections for 2030
    and 2050, expressed as Gg CO2 and CO2eq (from CH4 and N2O), by underlying agricultural
    emission sub-domain and by aggregate (agriculture total, agriculture total plus
    energy, agricultural soils).

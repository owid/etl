  description: "Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from burning of biomass consist of
    methane and nitrous oxide gases from biomass combustion of forest land cover classes
    \x91Humid and Tropical Forest\x92 and \x91Other Forests\x92, and of methane, nitrous
    oxide, and carbon dioxide gases from combustion of organic soils. The FAOSTAT
    emissions database is computed following Tier 1 IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National
    GHG Inventories (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol4.html). GHG
    emissions are provided by country, with global coverage, relative to the period
    1990-present (with annual updates), expressed as Gg CH4, Gg N2O, Gg CO2, Gg CO2eq
    and Gg CO2eq from both CH4 and N2O, by land cover class (humid tropical forest,
    other forest, organic soils) and by aggregate (burning - all categories). Implied
    emission factors for N2O, CH4 and CO2  as well activity data (burned area and
    biomass burned) are also provided."

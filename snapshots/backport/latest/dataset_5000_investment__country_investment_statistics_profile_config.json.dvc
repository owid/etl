  description: The Country Investment Statistics Profile domain provides an overall
    view of the information about investment in agriculture at country level. Data
    are collected from other FAOSTAT domains, in particular from Investment and Macro
    Indicators. The purpose is to give to the users a comprehensive dataset that allows
    making comparison among the different flows to agriculture within each country.
    The dataset consists of a time series of more than 200 countries, from 2001 onwards.
    The information included regards the levels of central government expenditure
    on agriculture, credit to agriculture, official development flows (commitment)
    and foreign direct investment on agriculture. Besides the levels of investment
    flows, the dataset also includes the information on agriculture value added and
    agriculture gross fixed capital formation. Additional reported indicators are
    -the share of total flow allocated to agriculture (for Government Expenditure
    on Agriculture, Credit to Agriculture, Development Flows, Foreign direct Investment
    to Agriculture), -the agriculture share of total GDP, -the agriculture share of
    total gross fixed capital formation, -the agriculture orientation index (ratio
    of the agriculture share of total flow, over the agriculture value added share
    of total GDP) for Government Expenditure on Agriculture, Credit to Agriculture,
    Development Flows to Agriculture, -the investment agriculture orientation index
    (which is the ratio between the agriculture share of gross fixed capital formation
    over the agriculture share of GDP), -the annual growth,-the investment ratio (ratio
    between gross fixed capital formation over GDP),-the agriculture investment ratio
    (ratio between agriculture gross fixed capital formation and agriculture value
    added). Though the goal is to have complete and consistent coverage for all countries,
    relatively low response rates for the different databases belonging to the investment
    domain and country level differences in data collection and reporting creates
    some challenges in providing a complete and consistent global dataset. The Country

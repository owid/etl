  description: "The Statistics Division of FAO collects annually data on Government
    Expenditure on Agriculture through a questionnaire, which was developed in partnership
    with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF is the responsible institution for
    the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) methodology and annually collects GFS
    data, including Expenditure by Functions of Government (COFOG). The Classification
    of the Functions of Government (COFOG) is an international classification developed
    by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and published
    by the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD), with the aim of categorise
    governments' functions according to their purposes. The FAO questionnaire aligns
    with Table 7 of the IMF GFS questionnaire, replicates the relevant aggregates
    and drills down to request additional detail related to Agriculture. The FAO dataset
    consists of a time series, from 2001 onwards, of Total Government Expenditure
    and expenditure in: Economic affairs; Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting,
    along with its three disaggregated subsectors of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing;
    and Environmental Protection. In addition, expenditure in each detailed function
    are further disaggregated into Recurrent and Capital expenditure. Additional indicators
    include the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure, and the Agriculture Orientation
    Index (ratio between the Agriculture Share of Government Expenditure and the Agriculture
    Value Added as Share of GDP). Though the goal is to have complete and consistent
    coverage for all countries, different stages of implementation of the GFS methodology
    and COFOG classification, and differences in the data collection and reporting
    at country level creates some challenges in providing a complete and consistent
    global dataset."

  description: "As part of the FAO Agriculture Capital Stock (ACS) database, ESS-FAO
    publishes country-by-country data on physical investment in agriculture, forestry
    and fishing as measured by the System of National Accounts (SNA) concept of Gross
    Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Additional variables included in the ACS are Net
    and Gross Capital Stock, Consumption of Fixed Capital, the Agriculture Investment
    ratio, and the Gross Fixed Capital Formation Agriculture Orientation Index.  \
    \ The FAO Agriculture Capital Stock Database is an analytical database: whenever
    available, the database integrates official National Accounts data harvested from
    the UNSD National Accounts Main Aggregates Database (UNSD AMA) and the OECD Annual
    National Accounts Database (OECD ANA). If the full set of official data is not
    available for any specific country, imputation methods are applied to obtain estimates
    over the complete time series. Many data points in ACS are estimated and are flagged
    as such; they do not represent official Member countries' submissions.  With a
    view of producing internationally comparable net capital stock estimates, we employ
    the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) with a time invariant geometric depreciation
    rate to impute missing data. The Perpetual Inventory Method is a well-established
    economic model to calculate Net Capital Stocks (NCS) and Consumption of Fixed
    Capital (CFC) from time series of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Specifically,
    annual measures of the NCS are obtained from cumulating historical series on physical
    investment flows and deducting the part of assets that are depreciated (the Consumption
    of Fixed Capital that occurs in every period).   In order to implement the PIM,
    long time series on aggregate GFCF in agriculture, forestry and fishing is required.
    As much as possible, we rely on National Accounts data published by the OECD and
    UNSD. When country data are partially or fully missing, we employ econometric
    techniques to impute missing observations. Depending on the pattern of data missingness
    for the countries, different imputation methods are applied (selected from the
    ARMAX, PANEL and OLS classes of econometric models). Working with the above-mentioned
    data sources, we can rely on country data - though very incomplete in some cases
    - on agriculture GFCF, CFC and/or NCS for 103 countries to guide us in our data
    gap filling exercise. For the other 104 countries included in the database, we
    fully rely on imputation methods. For a detailed description of the imputation
    methods and our PIM framework, refer to box 20.5.   All data series in the database
    are provided both in national currencies and in US dollars as well as in current
    prices and constant prices with base year 2010. Calculation of constant price
    series is done applying GFCF deflator series. When OECD National Accounts data
    are available, an OECD implicit deflator for agriculture GFCF is calculated and
    used. For other cases, the implicit deflators on GFCF for total economy available
    from the FAOSTAT Deflators database is used."

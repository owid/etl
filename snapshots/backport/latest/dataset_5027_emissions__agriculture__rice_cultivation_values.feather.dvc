  name: 'Emissions - Agriculture: Rice Cultivation'
  description: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from rice cultivation consist of methane
    gas from the anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in paddy fields. The FAOSTAT
    emissions database is computed following Tier 1 IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National
    GHG Inventories (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol4.html) and
    the IPCC 2000 Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National GHG
    Inventories (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gp/english/). GHG emissions
    are provided by country, regions and special groups, with global coverage, relative
    to the period 1961-present (with annual updates) and with projections for 2030
    and 2050, expressed both as Gg CH4 and Gg CO2eq. Implied emission factor for CH4
    and activity data are also provided.

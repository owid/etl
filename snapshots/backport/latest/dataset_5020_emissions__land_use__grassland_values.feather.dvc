  name: 'Emissions - Land Use: Grassland'
  description: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the domain "Grassland" are currently
    limited to the CO2 emissions from grassland organic soils. They are those associated
    with carbon losses from drained histosols under grassland. The FAOSTAT emissions
    database is computed following Tier 1 IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories
    (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol6.html)applied to geospatial
    data.GHG emissions are provided by country, region and special groups, with global
    coverage, relative to the period 1990-present (with annual updates), expressed
    as net emissions/removal Gg CO2 and Gg CO2eq. Implied emission factor for C, net
    stock change Gg C and activity data (area) are also provided.

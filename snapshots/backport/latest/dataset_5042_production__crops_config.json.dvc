  description: "Crop statistics are recorded for 173 products, covering the following
    categories: Crops Primary, Fibre Crops Primary, Cereals, Coarse Grain, Citrus
    Fruit, Fruit, Jute  Jute-like Fibres, Oilcakes Equivalent, Oil crops Primary,
    Pulses, Roots and Tubers, Treenuts and Vegetables and Melons. Data are expressed
    in terms of area harvested, production quantity and yield. The objective is to
    comprehensively cover production of all primary crops for all countries and regions
    in the world.Cereals: Area and production data on cereals relate to crops harvested
    for dry grain only. Cereal crops harvested for hay or harvested green for food,
    feed or silage or used for grazing are therefore excluded. Area data relate to
    harvested area. Some countries report sown or cultivated area only; however, in
    these countries the sown or cultivated area does not differ significantly in normal
    years from the area actually harvested, either because practically the whole area
    sown is harvested or because the area surveys are conducted around the harvest
    period.Vegetables, total (including melons): Data relate to vegetable crops grown
    mainly for human consumption. Crops such as cabbages, pumpkins and carrots, when
    explicitly cultivated for animal feed, are therefore excluded. Statistics on vegetables
    are not available in many countries, and the coverage of the reported data differs
    from country to country. In general, it appears that the data refer to crops grown
    in field and market gardens mainly for sale, thus excluding crops cultivated in
    kitchen gardens or small family gardens mainly for household consumption.Fruit,
    total (excluding melons): Data refer to total production of fresh fruit, whether
    finally used for direct consumption for food or feed, or processed into different
    products: dry fruit, juice, jam, alcohol, etc. Generally, production data relate
    to plantation crops or orchard crops grown mainly for sale. Data on production
    from scattered trees used mainly for home consumption are not usually collected.
    Production from wild plants, particularly berries, which is of some importance
    in certain countries, is generally disregarded by national statistical services.
    Therefore, the data for the various fruits and berries are rather incomplete.
    Bananas and plantains: Figures on bananas refer, as far as possible, to all edible
    fruit-bearing species of the genus Musa except Musa paradisiaca, commonly known
    as plantain. Unfortunately, several countries make no distinction in their statistics
    between bananas and plantains and publish only overall estimates. When this occurs
    and there is some indication or assumption that the data reported refer mainly
    to bananas, the data are included. The production data on bananas and plantains
    reported by the various countries are also difficult to compare because a number
    of countries report in terms of bunches, which generally means that the stalk
    is included in the weight. Dates, plantains and total grapes are included in the
    \x93total fruit\x94 aggregated figures, while olives are excluded.        Treenuts,
    aggregated: Production of nuts (including chestnuts) relates to nuts in the shell
    or in the husk. Statistics are very scanty and generally refer only to crops for
    sale. In addition to the kind of nuts shown separately, production data include
    all other treenuts mainly used as dessert or table nuts, such as pecan nuts, pili
    nuts, sapucaia nuts and macadamia nuts. Nuts mainly used for flavouring beverages
    are excludedas are masticatory and stimulant nuts and nuts used mainly for the
    extraction of oil or butter, including areca/betel nuts, cola nuts, illipe nuts,
    karate nuts, coconuts, tung nuts, oilpalm nuts etc."

  name: 'Emissions - Agriculture: Crop Residues'
  description: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from crop residues consist of direct
    and indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from nitrogen (N) in crop residues
    and forage/pasture renewal left on agricultural fields by farmers. Specifically,
    N2O is produced by microbial processes of nitrification and de-nitrification taking
    place on the deposition site (direct emissions), and after volatilization/re-deposition
    and leaching processes (indirect emissions).  The FAOSTAT emissions database is
    computed following Tier 1 IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories, Vol.
    4, Ch. 2 and 11(http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol4.html). GHG
    emissions are provided as direct, indirect and total by country, regions and special
    groups, with global coverage, relative to the period 1961-present (with annual
    updates) and with projections for 2030 and 2050, expressed as Gg N2O and Gg CO2eq,
    by crop and N content in residues.

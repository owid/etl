  description: 'Commodity balances show balances of food and agricultural commodities
    in a standardized form. The scope of standardization is to present these data
    in a less detailed form for a selected number of commodities without causing any
    significant loss of the basic variables monitoring the agricultural sector. The
    selected commodities include the equivalents of their derived products falling
    in the same commodity group, but exclude the equivalents of by-products and derived
    commodities, which through processing, change their nature and become part of
    different commodity groups. A number of commodity/item aggregates have been included
    to offer synthetic information. Some of these are included with the aim of simplifying
    the extraction of all component commodities. Data shown in the item aggregates
    represent the sum of the component commodities as presented in this domain (standardized
    form). Commodity coverage: The commodity list in this domain has been generally
    confined to primary commodities - except for sugar, oils and fats and beverages.  Whenever
    possible trade in processed commodities is expressed in the originating primary
    commodity equivalent. Rice is expressed in milled equivalent.'

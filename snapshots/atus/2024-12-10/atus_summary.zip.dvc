    title: American Time Use Survey
    description: |-
      The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) measures the amount of time people spend doing various activities, such as paid work, childcare, volunteering, and socializing. It provides nationally representative estimates of how, where, and with whom Americans spend their time, and is the only federal survey providing data on the full range of nonmarket activities, from childcare to volunteering.

    description_snapshot: |-
      The Activity summary file contains information about the total time each ATUS respondent spent doing each activity on the diary day. Because Activity codes have changed somewhat between 2003 and the present, this file uses activity codes that appear in the 2003â€“2023 ATUS Coding Lexicon (PDF).

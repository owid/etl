    UNAIDS leads the world's most extensive data collection on HIV epidemiology, programme
    coverage and finance and
    publishes the most authoritative and up-to-date information on the HIV epidemic.



    In some cases there is no data for some country and year. This can be a result
    of very small epidemics among women
    in the reproductive age which makes estimation of the mother to child transmission
    very unstable. Another reason for missing data
    is that relevant authorities may have asked UNAIDS not to share their estimates.


    This report makes clear that there is a path to end AIDS. Taking that path will
    help ensure preparedness to address
    other pandemic challenges, and advance progress across the Sustainable Development
    Goals. The data and real-world
    examples in the report make it very clear what that path is. It is not a mystery.
    It is a choice. Some leaders are
    already following the path—and succeeding. It is inspiring to note that Botswana,
    Eswatini, Rwanda, the United Republic
    of Tanzania and Zimbabwe have already achieved the 95–95–95 targets, and at least
    16 other countries (including eight
    in sub-Saharan Africa) are close to doing so.

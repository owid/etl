  description: >-
    This report makes clear that there is a path to end AIDS. Taking that path will help ensure preparedness to address
    other pandemic challenges, and advance progress across the Sustainable Development Goals. The data and real-world
    examples in the report make it very clear what that path is. It is not a mystery. It is a choice. Some leaders are
    already following the path—and succeeding. It is inspiring to note that Botswana, Eswatini, Rwanda, the United Republic
    of Tanzania and Zimbabwe have already achieved the 95–95–95 targets, and at least 16 other countries (including eight
    in sub-Saharan Africa) are close to doing so.

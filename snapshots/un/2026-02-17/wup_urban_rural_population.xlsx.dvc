    title: World Urbanization Prospects 2025 - Urban and Rural Population by National Definition
    description: |-
      Population estimates and projections for urban and rural areas based on national definitions of urban areas. The dataset provides population data in thousands at mid-year by region, subregion, country and area from 1950 to 2050.

      National definitions of "urban" vary considerably from country to country. Criteria such as population size, population density, type of economic activity, physical characteristics, level of infrastructure, or a combination of these may be used to define urban areas.

      Additional Information


      This long run cross-country dataset combines data from a number of sources.
      We took the estimates from the World Bank’s
      WDI as our base, and then extended coverage by adding literacy estimates from
      the CIA Factbook, as well as several other
      long-run series, as follows:



      - Data before 1800: Buringh, E., & Van Zanden, J. L. (2009). Charting the “Rise
      of the West”: Manuscripts and Printed
      Books in Europe, A long-term perspective from the sixth through eighteenth centuries.
      The Journal of Economic History.
      Online [here](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.553.9220&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
      Observations before
      1800 are plotted at the midpoint of the given time range (1475 refers to 1451–1500,
      1550 refers to 1501-1600 etc.)

      Further notes:


      - All sources rely on the same conceptual definition, but in many cases sources
      do not agree with one another. Because
      of this, year to year changes should be interpreted with caution. You can read
      more about literacy measurement here:
      https://ourworldindata.org/how-is-literacy-measured


      - The World Bank's WDI estimates correspond to UNESCO Institute for Statistics.
      OxLAD estimates come from several underlying
      sources (see original documentation for more details).


      - For Paraguay in 1982, the OxLAD data source was favoured over the World Bank
      (WDI) as the latter estimates literacy
      rates at 78.46%, a much lower estimate compared to neighbouring years for which
      there was data available.

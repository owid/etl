    title: "Charting the “Rise of the West”: Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries"
    description: |-
      This paper presents estimates of the development of manuscripts and printed books in
      Western Europe in the course of thirteen centuries. These estimates show that medieval
      and early modern book production was a dynamic economic sector, with an average
      annual growth rate of around one percent. Growth after the middle of the fifteenth
      century was probably a result of the decline in book prices and the growth of literacy.
      To explain the more complex dynamics of medieval book production we provide
      estimates of urbanization ratios and numbers for universities and monasteries.
      Monasteries seem to have been most important in the early period, while universities
      and laypeople dominated the later medieval demand for books.

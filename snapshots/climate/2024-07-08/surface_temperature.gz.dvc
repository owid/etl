    title: ERA5 monthly averaged data on single levels from 1940 to present
    description: |-
      ERA5 is the latest climate reanalysis produced by ECMWF, providing hourly data on many atmospheric, land-surface and sea-state parameters together with estimates of uncertainty.

      ERA5 data are available in the Climate Data Store on regular latitude-longitude grids at 0.25° x 0.25° resolution, with atmospheric parameters on 37 pressure levels.

      ERA5 is available from 1940 and continues to be extended forward in time, with daily updates being made available 5 days behind real time

      Initial release data, i.e., data no more than three months behind real time, are called ERA5T.

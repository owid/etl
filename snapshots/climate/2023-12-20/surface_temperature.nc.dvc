    title: ERA5-Land monthly averaged data from 1950 to present
    description: |-
      ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset offering a consistent view of land variables over several decades with enhanced resolution. It's produced by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis, combining model data with global observations.

      ERA5-Land focuses on water and energy cycles at surface level. It contains detailed records from 1950 onwards with a 1-hour temporal resolution. The native spatial resolution is 9km on a reduced Gaussian grid (TCo1279), regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.1x0.1 degrees for the CDS.

      This dataset presents a post-processed subset of ERA5-Land, featuring monthly-mean averages of 2m temperature. It covers the entire globe, with data available from January 1950 to present. The temperature is measured in kelvin, with conversions to Celsius available.

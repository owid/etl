    title: Near-Earth Asteroids
    description: |-
      The NASA Center for Near-Earth Objects Studies (CNEOS) maintains a catalog of all Near-Earth Asteroids known to date. A near-Earth asteroid is an asteroid whose orbit brings it into proximity with Earth. By convention, a Solar System body is considered "near Earth" if its closest approach to the Sun is less than 1.3 astronomical units (AU).

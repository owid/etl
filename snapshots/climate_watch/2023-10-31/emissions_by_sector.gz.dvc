    title: Greenhouse gas emissions by sector
    date_published: 2023-04-21
    description: |-
      Climate Watch Historical Emissions data contains sector-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data for 194 countries and the European Union for the period 1990-2019, including emissions of the six major GHGs from most major sources and sinks. Non-CO2 emissions are expressed in CO2 equivalents using 100-year global warming potential values from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.

      More information about the methodology can be found in [this document](https://wri-sites.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/climatewatch.org/www.climatewatch.org/climate-watch/wri_metadata/NDC_methodology.pdf).

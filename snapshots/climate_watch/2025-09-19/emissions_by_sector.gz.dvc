    title: Greenhouse gas emissions by sector
    description: |-
      Climate Watch Historical Emissions data contains sector-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including emissions of the six major GHGs from most major sources and sinks. Non-CO₂ emissions are expressed in CO₂ equivalents using 100-year global warming potential values from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report.

      More information about their data sources and methodology can be found in their [FAQ page](https://www.climatewatchdata.org/about/faq/ghg). Specifically, the definitions of all Climate Watch data sectors and their methodology are explained in [this document](https://wri-sites.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/climatewatch.org/www.climatewatch.org/climate-watch/wri_metadata/CW_GHG_Method_Note.pdf).

    title: Robot intelligence survey
    description: >
      Biannual tracker of Americans' concerns regarding robotic intelligence. Next
      update is in January. The provided results are
      weighted to ensure they are representative of the United States population across
      various demographic factors. The weighting
      is based on factors such as age, gender, race, education, region, political
      party affiliation, and income level. This
      weighting process helps to account for the diversity within the population and
      ensures that the results reflect a broader
      representation of the United States as a whole. Each wave comprises responses
      from 1004 - 1085 US Adults.


      Respondents were asked, "Which ONE, if any, of the following statements do you
      MOST agree with?"


      - Most robots have already developed higher levels of intelligence than humans


      - None of these


      - Robots will be able to develop higher levels of intelligence than humans in
      the future


      - Robots will never be able to develop higher levels of intelligence than humans


      - Don't know

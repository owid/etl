    title: Large Language Model Performance and Compute
    description: |-
      This dataset provides an analysis of how performance on a multi-modal language understanding (MMLU) benchmark scales with computational resources. It includes data on various large language models and their performance metrics.

      The dataset includes performance metrics for different language models, including their F1 score, perplexity, and other relevant metrics. The models are evaluated on a variety of tasks, including translation, summarization, and question answering.

      The data is collected from various sources, including published papers, preprints, and directly from the model developers. The dataset is updated annually to include the latest models and their performance metrics.

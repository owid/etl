  description: |
    Data from AI Index report on annual attendance of small conferences. It should be interpreted with caution given that many conferences in the last few years have had virtual or hybrid formats. Conference organisers report that measuring the exact attendance numbers at virtual conferences is difficult, as virtual conferences allow for higher attendance of researchers from around the world.

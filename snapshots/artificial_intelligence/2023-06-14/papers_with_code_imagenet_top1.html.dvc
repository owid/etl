  description: |
    ImageNet is one of the most widely used benchmarks for image classification. This dataset includes over 14 million images across 20,000 different object categories such as “strawberry” or “balloon.” Performance on ImageNet is measured through various accuracy metrics. Top-1 accuracy measures how often a system's single most probable label (out of 1000 possible labels) matches the target label.

      We update this chart with the latest available data from our source every month.

      The authors selected the AI systems for inclusion based on the following necessary criteria:
      — Have an explicit learning component
      — Showcase experimental results
      — Advance the state of the art

      In addition, the systems had to meet at least one of the following notability criteria:
      — Paper has more than 1000 citations
      — Historical importance
      — Important state-of-the-art advance
      — Deployed in a notable context

      The authors note that: "For new models (from 2020 onward) it is harder to assess these criteria, so we fall back to a subjective selection. We refer to models meeting our selection criteria as 'milestone models."

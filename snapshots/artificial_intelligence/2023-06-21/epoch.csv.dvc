    We update this chart with the latest available data from our source every month.

        The authors selected the AI systems for inclusion based on the following necessary criteria:
        — Have an explicit learning component
        — Showcase experimental results
        — Advance the state of the art

        In addition, the systems had to meet at least one of the following notability criteria:
        — Paper has more than 1000 citations
        — Historical importance
        — Important state-of-the-art advance
        — Deployed in a notable context

        The authors note that: "For new models (from 2020 onward) it is harder to assess these criteria, so we fall back to a subjective selection. We refer to models meeting our selection criteria as 'milestone models.'"

    description: |-
      This dataset represents a selection of indicators as presented in the 2025 edition of the Government at a Glance publication related to the public procurement spending as estimated under the System of National Accounts (SNA). Government at a Glance provides a dashboard of indicators assembled to help decision makers and the public analyse and benchmark governments across OECD members and partner countries. With a growing emphasis on governance outcomes, this ninth edition presents the latest evidence on public governance tools and resources that can help public administrations address complex, long-term challenges, while allowing progress to be monitored over time. The Structure and indicators section of the Government at a Glance publication, describes its framework and the structure by chapters. The 2025 edition of Government at a Glance presents a structure around three broad categories:

      1) Trust, security and dignity; prosperity and satisfaction with public services;
      2) Achieving results with good governance practices;
      3) What resources public institutions use and how are they managed.

    title: Annual Purchasing Power Parities and exchange rates
    description: |-
      This table shows annual Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) for Gross Domestic Product (GDP), household final consumption expenditure and actual individual consumption. It also shows exchange rates (annual averages and end of period), sourced from the International Monetary Fund's database on International Financial Statistics.

      Final consumption expenditure is the expenditure of resident households on consumption goods or services, while individual consumption is the sum of household consumption plus the individual (not collective) consumption of the non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) and General Government sectors

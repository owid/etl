    title: Marriage Rates in the United States
    description: |-
      Marriage license data is collected locally and reported to NVSS via the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. Coverage varies by year and state: Alaska and Hawaii were included from 1959 and 1960, respectively, while California, Louisiana, and Georgia had exclusions in specific years. Population counts for non-reporting states are excluded from rate calculations for those years. Reports and data are available on the CDC and NCHS websites.

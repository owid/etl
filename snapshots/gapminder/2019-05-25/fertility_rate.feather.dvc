      Data is that of version 12 of Gapminder, the latest version as of 2019. This
      is the full fertility rate dataset published
      by Gapminder.


      Gapminder's sources and methodology if well-documented in its dataset at: https://www.gapminder.org/data/


      It notes its data sources during three key periods of time:


      — 1800 to 1950 (and in some cases also years after 1950): Gapminder v6 which
      were compiled and documented by Mattias
      Lindgren.


      — 1950 to 2014: In most cases we use the latest UN estimates from World Population
      Prospects 2017 published in the file
      with Annually interpolated demographic indicators, called WPP2017_INT_F01_ANNUAL_DEMOGRAPHIC_INDICATORS.xlsx
      , accessed
      on September 2, 2017.


      — 2015 – 2099: We use the UN forecast of future fertility rate in all countries,
      called median fertility variant.


      Version 12 of the dataset extends back to the year 1800. Version 6 of Gapminder's
      fertility series includes data for
      a few countries further than 1800. We have included more historic data from
      Version 6 for Finland, the United Kingdom
      and Sweden. All data from 1800 onwards is from Version 12; data from pre-1800
      is from Version 6.


      There are significant uncertainties in data for many countries pre-1950. To
      develop full series back to 1800 for all
      countries, Gapminder combines published estimates within the academic literature
      and national statistics, with their
      own guesstimates and extrapolations for countries without published estimates.
      This series presents the selective Gapminder
      dataset: we have removed data points which were estimated by Gapminder with
      high uncertainty and instead only include
      those from published sources or the United Nations dataset.


      We also publish the full dataset from Gapminder for users looking for a complete
      series. However, we should highlight
      that some of these estimates have a high degree of uncertainty. This dataset

  description: |-
    The homicide rate data shown here is taken from Table 4 on pages 80-81 in Eisner (2015). In the table homicide rate estimates are given for a range of years, we present data for the mid-point year here. For example, if data is given for 1200-1299 we show this as 1250.

    Dataset notes:

    * For 1775 and 1862 the data for Switzerland are for the canton of Zurich only.
    * From 1825 onwards the estimates for Corsica and Sardinia are for Sardinia only.

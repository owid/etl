  description: |-
    Jones et al. (2023) quantify national and regional contributions to the increase of global mean surface temperature over the last few centuries. As they detail: the "dataset describing the global warming response to national emissions CO2, CH4 and N2O from fossil and land use sources during 1851-2021.

    National CO2 emissions data are collated from the Global Carbon Project (Andrew and Peters, 2022; Friedlingstein et al., 2022).

    National CH4 and N2O emissions data are collated from PRIMAP-hist (HISTTP) (GÃ¼tschow et al., 2022).

    We construct a time series of cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions for each country, gas, and emissions source (fossil or land use). Emissions of CH4 and N2O emissions are related to cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions using the Global Warming Potential (GWP*) approach, with best-estimates of the coefficients taken from the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al., 2021).

    Warming in response to cumulative CO2-equivalent emissions is estimated using the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE) approach, with best-estimate value of TCRE taken from the IPCC AR6 (Forster et al., 2021, Canadell et al., 2021). 'Warming' is specifically the change in global mean surface temperature (GMST)."

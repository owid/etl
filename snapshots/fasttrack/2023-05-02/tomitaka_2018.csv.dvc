  name: Symptoms of depression (Tomitaka et al. 2018)
  description: |-
    Data reports the frequency of depressive symptoms from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the United States (NHANES). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in 5372 individuals across the general population.

    The nine items of the PHQ-9 reflect the nine criteria on which DSM-5 diagnoses of depressive disorders are based. The PHQ-9 assesses the frequency of a variety of depressive symptoms within the past 2 weeks with 4-point response options: 0 = “not at all,” 1 = “several days,” 2 = “more than half the days,” and 3 = “nearly every day.”

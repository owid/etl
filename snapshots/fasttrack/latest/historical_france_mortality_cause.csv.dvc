  description: |-
    Dataset on mortality rates from each cause of death category in France between 1925 and 1999. The underlying data for this chart comes from the Institut National d'Études Démographiques, published by Jacques Vallin and France Meslé, and covers causes of deaths nationally in France between 1925 and 1999. Causes of death were categorized into categories according to the 9th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) manual. Mortality rates are given for five-year age bands, as an annual rate out of 100,000 people in that age group. Below are the ICD codes used for each cause category: All causes = 000*-999*,
    Infectious and parasitic diseases = 001*-139*,
    Neoplasms = 140*-239*,
    Endocrine nutritional and metabolic diseases and immunity disorders = 240*-279*,
    Diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs = 280*-289*,
    Mental disorders = 290*-319*,
    Diseases of the nervous system = 320*-359*,
    Diseases of the sense organs = 360*-389*,
    Diseases of the circulatory system = 390*-459*,
    Diseases of the respiratory system = 460*-519*,
    Diseases of the digestive system = 520*-579*,
    Diseases of the genitourinary system = 580*-629*,
    Complications of pregnancy childbirth and the puerperium = 630*-679*,
    Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue = 680*-709*,
    Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue = 710*-739*,
    Congenital anomalies = 740*-759*,
    Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period = 760*-779*,
    Symptoms signs and ill-defined conditions = 780*-799*,
    External causes (injury and poisoning) = 800*-999*

  name: Database on causes of death in France from 1925 to 1999
  description: >-
    Dataset on mortality rates from each cause of death category in France between
    1925 and 1999. The underlying data for
    this chart comes from the Institut National d'Études Démographiques, published
    by Jacques Vallin and France Meslé, and
    covers causes of deaths nationally in France between 1925 and 1999. Causes of
    death were categorized into categories according
    to the 9th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) manual.
    Mortality rates are given for five-year
    age bands, as an annual rate out of 100,000 people in that age group. Below are
    the ICD codes used for each cause category:
    All causes = 000*-999*,

    Infectious and parasitic diseases = 001*-139*,

    Neoplasms = 140*-239*,

    Diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs = 280*-289*,

    Mental disorders = 290*-319*,

    Diseases of the nervous system = 320*-359*,

    Diseases of the sense organs = 360*-389*,

    Diseases of the circulatory system = 390*-459*,

    Diseases of the respiratory system = 460*-519*,

    Diseases of the digestive system = 520*-579*,

    Diseases of the genitourinary system = 580*-629*,

    Complications of pregnancy childbirth and the puerperium = 630*-679*,

    Diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue = 680*-709*,

    Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue = 710*-739*,

    Congenital anomalies = 740*-759*,

    Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period = 760*-779*,

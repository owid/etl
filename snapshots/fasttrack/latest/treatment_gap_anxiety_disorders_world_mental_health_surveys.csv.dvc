    et al. 2017
  description: 'This dataset comes from the World Mental Health surveys, which conducted
    national studies in 21 countries, using validated structured interviews to survey
    members of the general population about symptoms of mental illnesses they had
    in the past 12 months and their lifetime so far. The source describes the dataset:
    "Data came from 24 community epidemiological surveys administered in 21 countries
    as part of the WMH surveys (Kessler & Ustun, 2004). These included 12 surveys
    carried out in high-income countries, 6 surveys in upper-middle-income countries
    and 6 in low or lower-middle income countries (see table 1). The majority of surveys
    were based on nationally representative household samples. Three were representative
    of urban areas in their countries (Colombia, Mexico, and Peru). Three were representative
    of selected regions in their countries (Japan, Nigeria, and Murcia, Spain). Four
    were representative of selected Metropolitan Areas (Sao Paulo, Brazil; Medellin,
    Colombia; and Beijing-Shanghai and Shenzhen in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China
    (PRC)). Trained lay interviewers conducted face-to-face interviews with respondents,
    aged 18 years and over. The interviews took place within the households of the
    respondents. To reduce respondent burden, the interview was divided into two parts.
    Part I assessed core mental disorders and was administered to all respondents.
    Part II, which assessed additional disorders and correlates, was administered
    to all Part I respondents who met lifetime criteria for any disorder plus a probability
    subsample of other Part I respondents. Part II data, the focus of this report,
    were weighted by the inverse of their probabilities of selection into Part II
    and additionally weighted to adjust samples to match population distributions
    on the cross-classification of key socio-demographic and geographic variables.
    Further details about WMH sampling and weighting are available elsewhere(Heeringa
    et al., 2008). Response rates ranged between 45.9% and 97.2% and had a weighted
    average of 70.1% across all surveys."'

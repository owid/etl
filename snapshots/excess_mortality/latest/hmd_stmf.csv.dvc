      In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HMD team decided to establish a new
      data resource: Short-term Mortality Fluctuations
      (STMF) data series. Objective and internationally comparable data are crucial
      to determine the effectiveness of different
      strategies used to address epidemics. Weekly death counts provide the most objective
      and comparable way of assessing
      the scale of short-term mortality elevations across countries and time. More
      details about this data project can be
      found in the recently published paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01019-1).


      Before using the data, please consult the STMF Methodological Note (https://www.mortality.org/File/GetDocument/Public/STMF_DOC/STMFNote.pdf),
      which provides a more comprehensive description of this data project, including
      important aspects related to data collection
      and data processing. We also recommend that you read the STMF Metadata (https://www.mortality.org/File/GetDocument/Public/STMF_DOC/STMFmetadata.pdf).
      This document includes country-specific information about data availability,
      completeness, data sources, as well as
      specific features of included data.


      Data will be frequently updated and new countries will be added. Data are published
      under CC BY 4.0 license.


      For citing STMF data, please follow the HMD data citation guidelines (https://www.mortality.org/Research/CitationGuidelines).

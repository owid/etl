    title: Cancers Attributable to Infections
    description: |-
      The dataset includes data on cancers linked to ten infectious pathogens classified as carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B and C viruses, and human papillomavirus (HPV). It includes population attributable fractions (PAFs), which estimate the proportion of cancer cases associated with each infection, and age-standardized rates (ASRs), which adjust for age distribution differences to allow for comparisons across populations.

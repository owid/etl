    title: ICBP SURVMARK-2 - Cancer Survival Rates
    description: |-
      ICBP SURVMARK-2 provides data on cancer survival, incidence, and mortality within the second phase of the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership (ICBP).

      ICBP is a unique and innovative global collaboration that brings together clinicians, policy-makers, researchers, and cancer data experts. It aims to measure international differences in cancer survival and, crucially, to identify factors that might be driving these differences.

      The ICBP SURVMARK-2 project was launched in July 2016 and is due to be completed in early 2020.

      The data presented are derived from 21 population-based cancer registries in seven countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom) and cover the period 1995â€“2014, with follow-up until 31 December 2015.

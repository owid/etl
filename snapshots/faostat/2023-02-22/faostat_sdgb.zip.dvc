  description: As the custodian agency of 21 SDG indicators, the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is responsible for curating and refining
    the methodologies of these indicators, collecting data from national sources,
    ensuring their quality and compatibility with applicable standards and classifications,
    and disseminating data at global level. This FAOSTAT domain complements the global
    SDG database administered by the United Nations Statistical Division, as well
    as FAO’s SDG indicators portal, by providing access to the available data for
    each of these indicators.  Please click the metadata link on the right hand navigation

    indicators, a description of data sources and the relevant contact persons responsible

    methodology, data sources and reporting procedures, please follow the link to
    the official SDG indicator metadata document available at the bottom of each summary

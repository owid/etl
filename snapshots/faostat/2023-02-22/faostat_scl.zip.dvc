  description: Supply Utilization Accounts and Food Balance Sheet present a comprehensive
    picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference
    period. The food balance sheet shows for each food item - i.e. each primary commodity
    and a number of processed commodities potentially available for human consumption
    - the sources of supply and its utilization. The total quantity of foodstuffs
    produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any
    change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period
    gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction
    is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put
    to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation,
    and food supplies available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each
    such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the
    respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of
    it. Data on per caput food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and - by
    applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products
    - also in terms of caloric value and protein and fat content.

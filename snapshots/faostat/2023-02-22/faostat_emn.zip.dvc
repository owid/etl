  description: 'The Livestock Manure domain of FAOSTAT contains estimates of nitrogen
    (N) inputs to agricultural soils from livestock manure. Data on the N losses to
    air and water are also disseminated. These estimates are compiled using official
    FAOSTAT statistics of animal stocks and by applying the internationally approved
    Guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Data are available
    by country, with global coverage and relative to the period 1961â€“2020, with annual
    updates. The following elements are disseminated: 1) Stocks; 2) Amount excreted
    in manure (N content);  3) Manure left on pasture (N content); 4) Manure left
    on pasture that volatilises (N content); 5) Manure left on pasture that leaches
    (N content); 6) Manure treated (N content); 7) Losses from manure treated (N content);
    8) Manure applied to soils (N content); 9) Manure applied to soils that volatilises
    (N content); 10) Manure applied to soils that leaches (N content).'

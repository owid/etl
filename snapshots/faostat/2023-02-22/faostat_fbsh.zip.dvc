    (2021)'
  description: Food Balance Sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern
    of a country's food supply during a specified reference period. The food balance
    sheet shows for each food item - i.e. each primary commodity and a number of processed
    commodities potentially available for human consumption - the sources of supply
    and its utilization. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added
    to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have
    occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available
    during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the
    quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food
    use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies
    available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each such food item available
    for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by
    the related data on the population actually partaking of it. Data on per caput
    food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and - by applying appropriate
    food composition factors for all primary and processed products - also in terms
    of caloric value and protein and fat content.

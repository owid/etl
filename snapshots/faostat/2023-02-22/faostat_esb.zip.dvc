  description: 2022 Cropland nutrient budget analytical briefThe Cropland Nutrient
    Budget domain contains information on the flows of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
    from synthetic fertilizer, manure applied to soils, atmospheric deposition, crop
    removal, and biological fixation over cropland and per unit area of cropland.
    The flows are aggregated to total inputs and total outputs, from which the overall
    nutrient budget and nutrient use efficiency on cropland are calculated. Statistics
    are disseminated in units of tonnes and in kg/ha, as appropriate. Nutrient use
    efficiency is expressed as a fraction (%). Data are available by country, with
    global coverage relative to the period 1961-2020, with annual updates.

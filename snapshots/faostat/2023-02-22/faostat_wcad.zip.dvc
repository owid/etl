  name: 'World Census of Agriculture: Structural data from agricultural censuses -
    FAO (2023)'
  description: Data from censuses of agriculture are collected at holding level and
    provide information about the structure of agriculture of a country or a territory
    (e.g. size and number of holdings, land tenure, legal status, and holder gender).
    An agricultural holding is an economic unit of agricultural production under single
    management comprising all livestock kept and all land used wholly or partly for
    agricultural production purposes. Member countries provided census data to FAO
    under the World Programme for the Census of Agriculture (WCA). National censuses
    are conducted at least once every ten years in an internationally comparable way.
    The ‘’Structural data from agricultural censuses’’ domain in FAOSTAT provides
    structural data from the last four WCA rounds (WCA 2020, 2010, 2000 and 1990)
    for each participating country and territory, to the extent possible. For earlier
    rounds (WCA 1930, 1950, 1960, 1970 and 1980) data are provided only on the number
    and area of holdings. The data are prepared based on the national census reports,
    later disseminated by FAO through the publications SDS 17, SDS 12 and SDS 9 and
    9a, and recent methodological review of the available country census data of WCA
    2020 round.

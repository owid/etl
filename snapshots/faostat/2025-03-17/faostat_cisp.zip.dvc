    title: 'Investment: Country Investment Statistics Profile'
    description: |-
      The Country Investment Statistics Profile domain provides an overall view of the information about investment in agriculture at country level. Data are collected from other FAOSTAT domains, in particular from Investment and Macro Indicators. The purpose is to give to the users a comprehensive dataset that allows making comparison among the different flows to agriculture within each country. The dataset consists of a time series of more than 200 countries, from 2001 onwards. The information included regards the levels of central government expenditure on agriculture, credit to agriculture, official development flows (commitment) and foreign direct investment on agriculture. Besides the levels of investment flows, the dataset also includes the information on agriculture value added and agriculture gross fixed capital formation. Additional reported indicators are -the share of total flow allocated to agriculture (for Government Expenditure on Agriculture, Credit to Agriculture, Development Flows, Foreign direct Investment to Agriculture), -the agriculture share of total GDP, -the agriculture share of total gross fixed capital formation, -the agriculture orientation index (ratio of the agriculture share of total flow, over the agriculture value added share of total GDP) for Government Expenditure on Agriculture, Credit to Agriculture, Development Flows to Agriculture, -the investment agriculture orientation index (which is the ratio between the agriculture share of gross fixed capital formation over the agriculture share of GDP), -the annual growth,-the investment ratio (ratio between gross fixed capital formation over GDP),-the agriculture investment ratio (ratio between agriculture gross fixed capital formation and agriculture value added). Though the goal is to have complete and consistent coverage for all countries, relatively low response rates for the different databases belonging to the investment domain and country level differences in data collection and reporting creates some challenges in providing a complete and consistent global dataset.

    trade partner data is used for non-reporting countries or missing cells, and data
    on food aid is added to take into account total cross-border trade flows. The
    trade database includes the following variables: export quantity, export value,
    import quantity, and import value. The trade database includes all food and agricultural
    products imported/exported annually by all the countries in the world.'

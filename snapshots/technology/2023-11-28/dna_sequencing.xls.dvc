    title: DNA Sequencing Costs
    description: |-
      The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) tracks the costs associated with DNA sequencing at the centers it funds. The cost-accounting data is summarized relative to two metrics: (1) "Cost per Megabase of DNA Sequence" - the cost of determining one megabase (Mb; a million bases) of DNA sequence of a specified quality; (2) "Cost per Genome" - the cost of sequencing a human-sized genome.

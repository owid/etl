    title: Cherry Blossom Full Bloom Dates in Kyoto, Japan
    description: |-
      A historical time series of peak cherry blossom bloom data from Kyoto, Japan. The timing of peak cherry blossom is linked to weather and climate factors. Warmer weather, due to climate change, is pulling peak cherry blossom earlier in the year.

      Yasuyuki Aono compiled this data based on multiple sources:

    title: State Capacity Dataset
    description: |-
      The State Capacity Dataset seeks to fill a gap in comparative, cross-national research by providing researchers with a measure that captures the multidimensionality of the concept and is distinct from other concepts of interest such as economic development or regime type. Version 1 of the dataset covers the years 1960-2015 for 177 countries.

      The methodology for the state capacity estimates is described in ["Leviathan's Latent Dimensions: Measuring State Capacity for Comparative Political Research."](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jkhanson/resources/hanson_sigman20.pdf) Additional documentation is provided in the [online appendix](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jkhanson/resources/StateCapac_v1_doc.pdf) associated with the article.

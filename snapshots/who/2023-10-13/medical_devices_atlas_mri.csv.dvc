    title: Global atlas of medical devices
    description: |-
      The **Global Atlas of Medical Devices (GAMD)** provides global, regional, and country data on the availability of:

        - National policy on health technology
        - Regulation of medical devices
        - Health technology assessment national unit
        - Health technology management
        - Use of medical devices nomenclature system
        - National lists of priority medical devices
        - High-cost medical equipment

      The GAMD also identifies that Member States designate a focal point for health technologies and medical devices. Each Member State designates a focal point in the ministry of health with the survey responses.

      The **WHO Baseline Country Survey on Medical Devices** was developed in 2009. The aim was to determine the health technology areas that required support in countries and regions. It was launched in February 2010. In 2013, it was updated and re-launched as the Global Atlas of Medical Devices. The GAMD was updated in 2017, and the 2022 update is under development.

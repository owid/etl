    title: Global atlas of medical devices
    description: |-
      The Global Atlas of medical devices (GAMD) provides global, regional and country data on availability of:

      national policy on health technology
      regulation of medical devices
      health technology assessment national unit
      health technology management
      use of medical devices nomenclature system
      national lists of priority medical devices
      high cost medical equipment.
      The GAMD also identifies that Member States designate a focal point for health technologies and medical devices. Each Member State designates a focal point in the ministry of health with the survey responses.

      WHO Baseline Country Survey on Medical Devices was developed in 2009. The aim was to determine the health technology areas that required support in countries and regions. It was launched in February 2010. In 2013  it was updated and re-launched as the Global Atlas of Medical Devices. The GAMD was updated in 2017 and the 2022 update is under development.

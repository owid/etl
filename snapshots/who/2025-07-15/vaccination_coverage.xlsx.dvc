    title: WHO Immunization Data - Vaccination coverage
    description: |-
      These estimates are based on quantitative data:

      1) Country-reported coverage data (official and administrative coverage)
      2) Survey coverage (from survey final reports, and complying with minimum set of quality criteria), and are informed by contextual information (e.g., stock-outs, changes in schedule, and other relevant information where available and appropriate).

      As such, these estimates are affected by the availability and quality of the underlying empirical data.

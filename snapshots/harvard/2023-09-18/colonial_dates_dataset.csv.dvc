    title: Colonial Dates Dataset (COLDAT)
    description: The Colonial Dates Dataset (COLDAT) aggregates information on the
      reach and duration of European colonial empires from renowned secondary sources.
      By aggregating secondary sources, rather than collecting from primary sources,
      the new dataset reflects the accumulated knowledge in the discipline and relieves
      researchers from making hard to justify choices between different historical
      datasets.

      The dataset only considers the colonial status of countries that are independent today. It also includes overseas colonies only.

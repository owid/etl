  description: |
    The Correlates of War (COW) Project has utilized a classification of wars that is based upon the status of territorial entities, in particular focusing on those that are classified as members of the inter-state system (referred to as “states”). This dataset encompasses wars in the middle category – wars that take place between a state(s) and a nonstate entity outside the borders of the state, or extra-state wars.

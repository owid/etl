    The Correlates of War (COW) Project has utilized a classification of wars that is based upon the status of territorial entities, in particular focusing on those that are classified as members of the inter-state system (referred to as “states”). This dataset encompasses wars that take place between or among the recognized states, or inter-state wars.

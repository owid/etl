"""Script to create a snapshot of dataset 'COW War Data, 1816 â€“ 2007 (v4.0)'.

This dataset is built from four different datasets:

    - Non-state wars: The use of armed force between two organised armed groups.
    - Intra-state wars: A conflict between a government and a non-governmental party, with no interference from other countries.
    - Inter-state wars: A conflict between two or more governments.
    - Extra-state wars: An extra-systemic conflict is a conflict between a state and a non-state group outside its own territory. These conflicts are by definition territorial, since the government side is fighting to retain control of a territory outside the state system.

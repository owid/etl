"""Script to create a snapshot of dataset 'COW War Data, 1816 â€“ 2007 (v4.0)'.

This dataset is built from four different datasets:

    - One-sided Violence: An actor-year dataset with information of intentional attacks on civilians by governments and formally organized armed groups.
    - Non-State Conflict: A conflict-year dataset containing information on communal and organized armed conflict where none of the parties is the government of a state.
    - Battle-Related Deaths: A dyad-year dataset with information on the number of battle-related deaths in the conflicts from 1989-2021 that appear in the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset.

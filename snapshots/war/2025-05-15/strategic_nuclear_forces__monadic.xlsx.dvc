    title: The Strategic Nuclear Forces Dataset
    description: |-
      This dataset describes times-series-cross-sectional information on all nuclear-armed states' strategic nuclear forces, and provides three indicators: the deliverable strategic warhead count, the equivalent megatonnage (EMT) index, and the counter military potential (CMP) index.

      The original data exists in two different formats:
      1. In the dyadic format, each row in the data corresponds to a pair of states, and the nuclear capabilities of a state depends on the distance to the other state. For example, a country may have a certain number of warheads, but not all of them could be delivered to a very distant country.
      2. In the monadic format, each row corresponds to just one country. This data shows the nuclear capabilities of a state, regardless of what country they could be used against.

      The current dataset is presented in monadic format.

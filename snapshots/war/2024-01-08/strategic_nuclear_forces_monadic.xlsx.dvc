    title: The Strategic Nuclear Forces Dataset
    description: |-
      This dataset describes times-series-cross-sectional information on all nuclear-armed states' strategic nuclear forces, and provides three indicators: the deliverable strategic warhead count, the equivalent megatonnage (EMT) index, and the counter military potential (CMP) index.
    title_snapshot: The Strategic Nuclear Forces Dataset - Monadic data
    description_snapshot: |-
      This dataset (sent to Our World in Data by K. Suh in a private communication) is in monadic format.

      The original dataset is in dyadic format. This means that each row in the data corresponds to a pair of states, and the nuclear capabilities of a state depends on the distance to the other state. For example, a country may have a certain number of warheads, but not all of them could be delivered to a very distant country.

      On the other hand, each row in the monadic data corresponds to just one country. This data shows the nuclear capabilities of a state, regardless of what country they could be used against.

      Project Mars. This dataset records new data on 229 unique belligerents in 252
      conventional wars fought between 1800 and 2011.
      Project Mars introduces new data about these belligerents, including their level
      of prewar military inequality, and new measures
      of battlefield performance, including desertion, defection, and fratricidal
      violence.
      The latest version is Version 1.1. (2022-02-08).

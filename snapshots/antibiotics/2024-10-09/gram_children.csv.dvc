    title: Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) - by antibiotic group
    description: |-
      The Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) Project is a partnership between the University of Oxford and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, to provide rigorous quantitative estimates of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) burden; to increase global-, regional-, and country-level awareness of AMR; to boost surveillance efforts, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMICs); and, to promote the rational use of antimicrobials worldwide.

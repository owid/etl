    title: ESC Cardiovascular Statistics
    description: |-
      The European Heart Health Institute coordinates the ESC Cardiovascular Statistics and Atlas projects, aiming to support evidence-based policy and practice in European cardiology. The project seeks to understand health systems across Europe, identify cost-effective practices, and facilitate their widespread use. It's a significant initiative that tries to bring detailed, accurate health data to the forefront of policy and practice in cardiology across Europe.

      The ESC Atlas of Cardiology is a key initiative, gathering data on healthcare systems from ESC member countries. It provides a range of information, from geographical and demographic data to specifics about healthcare organization and financing. Notably, it features a detailed section on cardiology, offering insights into cardiac care services, resources, and reimbursement methods where available.

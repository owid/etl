/*
COMMANDS TO EXTRACT TRUST QUESTIONS FROM THE INTEGRATED VALUES SURVEY

This code collapses microdata from the Integrated Values Survey (World Values Survey + European Values Survey) and generates a csv file.

NOTE: For now I am extracting data on trust, but this will be expanded in 2024 to include other variables.

INSTRUCTIONS

	1.	Follow the instructions to construct the IVS file from WVS and EVS microdata here: https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSEVStrend.jsp
			The files required are the WVS and EVS trend files, and the merge syntax file (in our case in Stata). Keep these files in the same folder.
	2.	Run the EVS_WVS_Merge_Syntax_stata 4.do file in Stata. This will generate the IVS main dataset.
	3.	Run this do-file in Stata. It will generate the file ivs.csv
	4.	Add snapshot. Currently the command is
 			python snapshots/ivs/{date}/integrated_values_survey.py --path-to-file snapshots/ivs/{date}/ivs.csv
	5.	Delete csv file
	6.	Run `etl wvs_trust`

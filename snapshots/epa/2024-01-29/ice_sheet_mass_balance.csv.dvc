    description: |-
      This dataset includes the cumulative change in mass in the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica since 1992.

      This indicator is presented in two different ways, based on two different sources:
      * IMBIE, an average value based on more than 20 different studies.
        * The uncertainty estimates from the various datasets that feed into the combined average.
      * NASA JPL: A commonly cited analysis by NASA JPL, which includes seasonal variations.

      All estimates are centered at zero in 2002 to provide a consistent point of reference. Thus, a downward slope indicates a net loss of ice and snow.
      For reference, 1,000 billion metric tons is equal to about 260 cubic miles of iceâ€”enough to raise sea level by about 3 millimeters.

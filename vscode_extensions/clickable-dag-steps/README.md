# Clickable DAG Steps

**Clickable DAG Steps** is a VS Code extension that makes `dag.yml` files easier to navigate by turning DAG entries like `data://...` and `export://...` into clickable links. These links open the corresponding Python ETL scripts in your workspace.

## Usage

Once this extension is installed, simply Cmd/Ctrl+Click on a step entry.

# Why Now?

**The opportunity and the challenge**

- **LLMs are changing UX expectations**
  - Google AI mode shows what's possible
  - Simple search bars may not be enough in the AI age

- **Current system is failing users**
  - 21% of queries return zero results
  - Straightforward queries like "public school funding" fail

- **Reputation considerations**
  - Test AI on structured data (our strength)
  - Avoid ChatGPT/MCP pitfalls (hallucinations, unreliability)
  - Users trust us for accurate data, not generative text

# Problems

---

# Problem 1: Mapping Natural Language Queries

Users express intent in natural language, but keyword search doesn't match anything

- **User query**: "How has life expectancy changed over time?"
- **What they mean**: Time-series data on life expectancy
- **What keyword search sees**: No exact phrase match → **zero results**

**Challenge**: Understanding user intent vs. matching text strings

---

# Problem 2: Zero Search Results

**21% of queries return no results** even when relevant content exists

**Real examples that fail:**
- "public school funding"
- "road traffic deaths age"
- "average hours of work per week"

**Why this happens:**
- **Vocabulary mismatch**: "CO2 emissions" vs "carbon dioxide"
- **Spelling variations**: "labour" vs "labor", "urbanisation" vs "urbanization"
- **Phrasing differences**: "GDP per capita" vs "GDP per person"

**Impact**: Users think content doesn't exist → **immediate frustration** → abandon search

---

# Problem 3: Irrelevant Results

Search returns results that technically match but aren't what the user wants

**Real examples of mismatched results:**
- "population" → returns Mpox disease statistics
- "populism" → returns population data
- "money" → returns military expenditures
- "physical exercise" → returns child labor topics

**The problem**: Keyword matching ignores semantic relationships

**The result**: Low-quality results ranked highly, relevant content buried

| **Hybrid Search** | ~2020 | Combining keyword + semantic |
| **Agentic RAG** | ~2023 | LLM agents with reasoning |
| **Future?** | ~2025+ | Multimodal, reinforcement learning |

---

# Keyword Search (~1990s)

**Traditional information retrieval**: Term frequency, inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)

**Pros:**
- Fast and predictable
- Well understood, easy to debug
- Works well for exact matches

**Cons:**
- No understanding of semantics
- Vocabulary mismatch problems
- Can't handle natural language queries

**Cost/Latency:**
- Free with Algolia (our current provider)
- ~10-50ms latency

---

# Semantic Search (~2018)

**Neural embeddings**: Convert text to vectors in semantic space

**Pros:**
- Understands meaning, not just words
- Handles synonyms and related concepts
- Better for natural language queries
- **Multilingual**: 33% of users have non-English language

**Cons:**
- Can miss exact keyword matches
- Requires model deployment
- More computationally expensive

**Cost/Latency:**
- ~$10-15/month
- ~50-200ms latency

---

# Hybrid Search (~2020)

**Best of both worlds**: Combine keyword + semantic search with reranking

**Pros:**
- Captures both exact matches and semantic meaning
- More robust than either alone
- Can tune keyword vs semantic weight

**Cons:**
- More complex to implement
- Requires careful balancing of signals
- Higher computational cost

**Cost/Latency:**
- ~$20/month (requires switch from Algolia to Typesense)
- ~100-300ms latency

---
zoom: 0.95
---

# Agentic RAG (~2023)

**LLM-powered retrieval**: Agent reasons about query, retrieves, and generates answers

**Pros:**
- Extremely flexible and powerful
- Can handle complex, multi-step queries
- Natural language interaction

**Cons:**
- Expensive per query
- Slower response times
- Non-deterministic results
- Can fail to return expected JSON format

**Cost/Latency:**
- ~$200/month
- ~1-5s latency

---


# Vocabulary: The Foundation

**Bridging user language to our taxonomy**

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

**Keyword Search**
- Inverted index (A-B-C)
- Exact match required
- Limited synonym support

**Limitations:**
- "public school funding" → no results
- "road traffic deaths age" → no results
- Phrase matching is brittle

</div>

<div>

**Semantic Search**
- Embeddings/vectors
- Maps "solar power" → "renewable energy"
- Understands related concepts

**Benefits:**
- Handles synonyms naturally
- Works across languages (33% of users non-English)
- Bridges vocabulary gaps

# Pitches

---
zoom: 0.8
---

# Pitch 1: The 'Zero Result' Safety Net

**Problem**: Users get no results even when relevant content exists

**Solution**: Deploy hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
- Keyword search catches exact matches
- Semantic search catches related concepts
- Reranking combines signals

**Implementation**:
- Switch from Algolia to Typesense
- Matthieu had a prototype in the pipeline

**Benefits**:
- Dramatically reduce zero-result queries
- Better handling of vocabulary mismatches
- Improved user satisfaction

**Cost/Latency**:
- ~$20/month
- ~100-300ms latency

---
zoom: 0.8
---

# Pitch 2: Suggested Keywords

**Problem**: Users don't know what terms to search for

**Solution**: Show related search keywords as user types
- Real-time keyword suggestions
- Based on vocabulary from our charts/articles
- Help users refine their queries

**Implementation**:
- Build vocabulary index from our content
- Semantic search over the vocabulary
- Display relevant keywords dynamically

**Benefits**:
- Guide users to successful queries
- Expose available content
- Reduce failed searches

**Cost/Latency**:
- Included in semantic search costs (~$10-15/month)
- ~50-100ms latency

---
zoom: 0.75
---

# Pitch 3: Suggested Topics

**Problem**: Users may not know what topics are available

**Solution**: Context-aware topic recommendations
- Show related topics based on current query
- Display when search returns zero results
- Showcase our topic searches (which are really good!)
- Show featured metrics

**Implementation**:
- Trivial: Show LLM our 100+ topics and ask for recommendations
- LLM selects most relevant topics for the query

**Benefits**:
- Increase content discovery
- Improve exploration experience
- Connect related datasets
- Turn failed searches into successful explorations

**Cost/Latency**:
- Minimal (mostly existing infrastructure)
- ~50ms latency

# Pitch 4: Semantic Search on Cloudflare

**Approach**: Semantic search + query rewriting + reranking via Cloudflare AI Search

**Components**:
1. Query rewriting (expand/normalize)
2. Semantic search (embeddings)
3. Reranking (learned model)

**Pros**:
- Much cheaper than agentic approach
- Predictable latency
- Good quality results

**Cons**:
- Hard to customize (not particularly customizable or good)
- Less flexible than agents
- Cloudflare-specific implementation

**Cost/Latency**: Included in Cloudflare pricing, ~100-200ms

---
zoom: 0.78

# Problematic Queries

**Real examples from testing that highlight system limitations**

**Zero Results (should find content):**
- "public school funding"
- "road traffic deaths age"
- "average hours of work per week"

**Vocabulary Mismatch:**
- "poland modern economic miracle" → needs "GDP growth" understanding
- "is Italy richer then France?" → needs "GDP per capita" concept

**Natural Language Understanding:**
- "How has life expectancy changed over time?" → needs time-series intent
- "physical exercise" → returns child labor topics

**Ambiguous/Multi-intent:**
- "population" → shows Mpox statistics instead of demographics
- "populism" → returns population data
- "money" → shows military expenditures

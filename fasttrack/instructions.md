1. Copy [Fast-track template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j_mclAffQ2_jpbVEmI3VOiWRBeclBAIr-U7NpGAdV9A/edit?usp=sharing) and copy your data into `data` sheet. You can leave metadata blank and check the `Fill metadata` checkbox to automatically fill in the metadata from the data sheet.

2. Click on `File -> Share -> Publish to Web` and share the entire document as csv. Copy the link to the form below. Next time you successfully import it, it'll be available in `Existing Google Sheets` dropdown.

    _Do not "restrict access to your organization" even if your data is private. It is unlikely anyone would access the link by chance._

3. Make sure to check `Make dataset private`, this will let you explore your dataset in Admin without publishing it.

4. Submit the form and resolve all validation errors.

5. Explore your data in Admin, create charts, etc.

6. Fill in metadata in Google Sheet. It is recommended to **use `snake_case` format for variable names** in `data` sheet and set their titles in `variables_meta` sheet. Overwriting title then updates the variable instead of creating a new one.

7. Once you're happy with the dataset, rerun this form with `Make dataset private` unchecked.

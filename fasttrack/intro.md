# Fast-Track

Fast-track is a tool for importing datasets from Google Sheets. The idea is to keep all data and metadata there, and use this interface to import or update the data in grapher database where it can be used to create charts. Fast-track also commits your work to [ETL repository](https://github.com/owid/etl) where you can further process your data with Python.

So far you have learned about the standard steps. These should cover most of the cases. However, there are some other steps worth mentioning.

## Explorers
Data explorers are Grapher charts expanded with additional functionalities to facilitate exploration, such as dynamic entity filters or customizable menus. They are powered by CSV files generated by ETL [served from S3](https://dash.cloudflare.com/078fcdfed9955087315dd86792e71a7e/r2/default/buckets/owid-catalog). Explorers data step in ETL is responsible for generating these CSV files. It works in the same way as e.g. garden step, but the transformations made there are meant to get the data ready for the data explorer (and not be consumed by users of catalog).

## Backport
Datasets from our production grapher database can be backported to ETL catalog.

These is useful when a dataset was imported to Grapher not by using the ETL (years ago, or manually imported datasets through the admin) and we want to make it available in ETL.

## Open Numbers
!!! warning "TO BE DONE"

## ETag
A step used to mark dependencies on HTTPS resources. The path is interpreted as an HTTPS url, and a HEAD request is made against the URL and checked for its `ETag`. This can be used to trigger a rebuild each time the resource changes.


!!! warning "This step is rarely used"

    Currently it is only used to import some COVID-19 data, which is published by us in another project.

    ```yaml title="dag/health.yml"
    data://garden/owid/latest/covid:
    - etag://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv
    ```

## GitHub
An empty step used only to mark a dependency on a Github repo, and trigger a rebuild of later steps whenever that repo changes. This is useful since Github is a good store for data that updates too frequently to be snapshotted into Walden, e.g. Gapminder's [open-numbers](https://github.com/open-numbers/).

The most recent commit hash of the given branch will be used to determine whether the data has been updated. This way, the ETL will be triggered to rebuild any downstream steps each time the data is changed.

!!! example
    ```yaml title="dag/open_numbers.yml"
    data://open_numbers/open_numbers/latest/bp__energy:
    - github://open-numbers/ddf--bp--energy
    ```

!!! note
    Github rate-limits unauthorized API requests to 60 per hour, so we should be sparing with the use of this step as it is implemented today.


## Private steps
In some cases, a source or publisher does not allow for re-publication of their data. When that happends, but we still want to use their data in ETL, we use _private steps_.

Private steps work the same way as regular steps and are the only difference is that the data from these steps is not made available in our catalog and APIs.

In the [DAG](../../design/dag.md), these steps appear with the prefix `data-private://`.


!!! example
    The garden step for the "Drug Use Disorders - Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019)" dataset by the IHME is private. Their URI looks like:
    ```
    data-private://garden/ihme_gbd/2023-03-29/gbd_drug_disorders
    ```

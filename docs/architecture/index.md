!!! abstract "Our World In Data is a publication that makes very heavy use of data to communicate about global issues."

The best data on global issues comes from **the hard work of _data providers_**, which can be individual researchers, small research groups, or big institutions like the UN or World Bank. Since we reuse this work, **we are effectively a _data republisher_** that tries to process and understand data from a wide variety of sources, and present it to the public in a unified way.

As a data republisher, we therefore need a methodology to process, version, and maintain several datasets all the way from the original source's publication wite to our platform. And it needs to be scalable.

We've had [our own journey](our-journey.md) in the search for this methodology for some time, which has now converged into what we know as _the ETL_. In this section we describe [its design prinicples](design) and [workflow](workflow/index.md).

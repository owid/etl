Typically, a dataset URI consists of four main parts:

    data://<channel>/<namespace>/<version>/<dataset-or-file>


* **channel**: Level of curation of the dataset. In this case, the channel is `garden`.
* **namespace**: A way to group similar datasets. The similarity might come from the topic (e.g. `health`) or the source (as in this example, `un`).
* **version**: Version of the dataset. Typically a date. In this case, the version is `2022-11-29`.
* **dataset** short name: Short name to identify the dataset (or file). In this case, the short name is `undp_hdr`.

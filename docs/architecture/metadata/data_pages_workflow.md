# Data Pages Workflow

## Live Reloading of a Data Page

When modifying a YAML file for a Data page, executing the `etl ... --grapher` command to visualize updates can be inefficient. The following steps outline a streamlined approach for rapid development and testing.

### Example Step
For illustration, the step `grapher/gcp/2023-07-10/global_carbon_budget` is considered. The corresponding YAML file, `global_carbon_budget.meta.yml`, is assumed to be edited within the grapher channel and previewed on a [staging Data page](http://staging-site-mojmir/admin/datapage-preview/738081).

### Initial Configuration
- Add `DEBUG=1` to your `.env.myname` file and any other `.env.*` files in use to expedite ETL operations. `DEBUG=1` runs all steps in a single process and removes 2s overhead from running each step.
- Add `PREFER_DOWNLOAD=1` to your environment to use cached downloads of files instead of redownloading them each time, which can significantly speed up steps involving large file downloads.

### File Monitoring
- Execute the ETL command with the `--watch` flag. This monitors the YAML file for changes and automatically re-executes the corresponding step. This might not be as useful for long-running steps.

### Data Filtering
- If the dataset contains numerous indicators, consider using `SUBSET=consumption_emissions_per_capita` to filter the data to only relevant variables. This is optional for smaller datasets.

### Instant YAML Updates
- Use `INSTANT=1` environment variable to enable instant YAML updates, which bypasses the normal ETL pipeline for metadata changes. This makes YAML changes appear almost immediately in the grapher without re-running the entire ETL process.
- Example usage: `INSTANT=1 etl grapher/gcp/2023-07-10/global_carbon_budget --grapher`
- Note: Instant mode only works for metadata changes. Any changes to data processing in Python will still require a full ETL run.

#### Limitations
This might fail, be slow or give unexpected results in the following cases:

- Garden step doesn't call `paths.create_dataset` as the last command (e.g. when it programmatically post-processes metadata)
- Grapher code is doing some heavy lifting or flattening

### Optional Optimization
- Include the `--only` flag in the command to further improve performance by avoiding dependency checks.

### Command Summary
```bash
# Basic command with watch mode
ENV_FILE=.env.myname SUBSET=consumption_emissions_per_capita etl grapher/gcp/2023-07-10/global_carbon_budget --grapher --watch --only
```
!!! note

    Working on your local grapher instead of a remote grapher will also reduce upload times. One option is to work on local grapher to begin with, and move to your staging server at a later point to be able to share the result with other colleagues.

### Usage
After initiating the above command, changes made to the YAML file can be reviewed by refreshing the [staging Data page](http://staging-site-mojmir/admin/datapage-preview/738081). The updates should be reflected promptly.

!!! info

    If editing the YAML file in the **garden channel** and the step execution time is long, refresh latency will be dependent on the step's runtime. In such cases, consider developing the YAML file in the **grapher channel** before moving it into the garden channel (if the table and indicator names are identical).

### Workflow Best Practices

1. **Start with INSTANT mode:** Begin with `INSTANT=1` for rapid YAML changes to test metadata updates without waiting for full ETL runs.

2. **Use PREFER_DOWNLOAD wisely:** Enable this for steps with large downloads to avoid repeatedly downloading the same files.

3. **Local development first:** Develop on local grapher before moving to staging for faster iteration cycles.

4. **Switch to full ETL runs:** Once metadata is finalized, run a complete ETL process to ensure all changes are properly integrated.

5. **Combine optimization flags:** For the fastest development experience, combine `DEBUG=1`, `PREFER_DOWNLOAD=1`, and `INSTANT=1` as shown in the command summary.

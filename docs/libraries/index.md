# Libraries

We have developed various python libraries that are used in our projects.

## [`owid.catalog`](catalog.md)
Data management with rich metadata support. Implements core data structures used in ETL.

## [`owid.repack`](repack.md)
Data packaging and optimization. Automatically reduces memory usage of pandas DataFrames by converting columns to more efficient data types.

## [`owid.datautils`](datautils.md)
Data processing utilities. Examples are functions to help with data cleaning, transformation, and geographic data harmonization.

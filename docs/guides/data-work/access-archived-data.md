Sometimes, you may need to access archived datasets or snapshots and compare them with current datasets. Here are the recommended approaches:

---

### Going Back in Git History

The simplest way to access older datasets is by checking out a previous Git commit and running the ETL process from that point in time.

1. **Find the commit of interest**:
   - Open the file in GitHub.
   - Click the `History` button.
   - Select the desired commit and copy its SHA (click the copy button).

2. **Checkout the commit**:
   ```bash
   git checkout <SHA>
   ```

3. **Re-run the ETL**:
   ```bash
   make .venv
   etlr <dataset>
   ```

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Run this in a separate folder (e.g., `etl2`) to retain access to the current datasets. This setup allows you to compare datasets in a notebook.

Example comparison in Python:
```python
from etl.dataset import Dataset

# Load current dataset
tb_current = Dataset("~/projects/etl/data/garden/climate/latest/weekly_wildfires").read_table('wildfires')

# Load dataset from a previous commit
tb_old = Dataset("~/projects/etl2/data/garden/climate/latest/weekly_wildfires").read_table('wildfires')
```

### Updating Snapshot MD5 for Archived Snapshots

If the code hasnâ€™t changed and only new snapshots have been created (e.g., for automatically updated datasets), you can modify the snapshot MD5 in the `.dvc` file to point to an older snapshot.

1. **Find the MD5 and size**:
   - Locate the desired commit in GitHub.
   - Copy the MD5 and size from the relevant `.dvc` file (e.g., `snapshots/climate/latest/weekly_wildfires.csv.dvc`).

2. **Update the `.dvc` file locally**:
   - Replace the MD5 and size in your local `.dvc` file.

3. **Re-run the ETL** with the updated MD5:
   ```bash
   make .venv
   etlr <dataset>
   ```

ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: For chart comparisons, create a PR with the updated `.dvc` file, commit the changes, and use the chart diff tool. Enable "Show all charts" to view them side-by-side.

### Comparing Snapshots

To directly compare snapshots, use the `etl.snapshot` module.

1. **Load the current snapshot**:
   ```python
   from etl.snapshot import Snapshot

   snap = Snapshot("climate/latest/weekly_wildfires.csv")
   snap.pull()
   pd.read_csv(snap.path).shape
   ```

2. **Load an older snapshot**:
   - Find its MD5 and size from a previous commit.
   - Update the MD5 and size in your script:
     ```python
     from etl.snapshot import Snapshot

     snap = Snapshot("climate/latest/weekly_wildfires.csv")
     snap.metadata.outs[0]["md5"] = "356177e363926b959f5af281443f0a35"
     snap.metadata.outs[0]["size"] = 12548867
     snap.pull()
     pd.read_csv(snap.path).shape
     ```

Once you have successfully [created and submitted your chart revisions](../updating-charts), you should go to the admin tool "Suggested chart revisions". You can find it in the admin panel, on the right menu bar under "DATA".


In there, you will be presented with all the chart revisions, which you can either approve or reject. Note that you can filter these by the user that created them.

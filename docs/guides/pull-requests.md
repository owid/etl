We use pull requests (PRs) to propose changes to the codebase. They are the best way to suggest changes to the codebase, and they are also the best way to get feedback on your work.

Every PR in the ETL repository has an associated [staging server](staging-servers) created to it. To smooth this process, we have automated this with the command `etl pr`.

!!! tip "[Learn more about how to use the `etl pr` command](etl-cli/#etl-pr)"

## Owidbot
Once you create a PR, automation user [@owidbot](https://github.com/owidbot) will add a comment to the PR with information related to your PR work.

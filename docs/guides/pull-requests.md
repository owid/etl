We use pull requests (PRs) to propose changes to the codebase. They are the best way to suggest changes to the codebase, and they are also the best way to get feedback on your work.

Every PR in the ETL repository has an associated [staging server](staging-servers) created to it. To smooth this process, we have automated all of this with the command `etl pr`.

!!! tip "[Learn more about how to use the `etl pr` command](../etl-cli/#etl-pr)"

## PR work summary
Once you've created a PR, the automation user [@owidbot](https://github.com/owidbot) will add a comment to the PR summarizing your work in the PR and providing links to relevant resources. This comment will include the following information:

- Quick links: Links to the site and tooling using changes introduced by the PR. This includes admin site, public site, Wizard, documentation.
- Login: Instructions on how to ssh into the staging server.
- chart-diff: Wizard app showing chart changes (if any) compared to PRODUCTION. Owidbot will complain if there are chart changes pending review.
- data-diff: Changes introduced in the data compared to PRODUCTION.

## Scheduling a PR merge

You can schedule a PR merge by using the command `/schedule` at the end of your PR description. This is useful whenever you want to merge your PR at a specific time, e.g. nightly if it could trigger a long deployment process in the main branch.

You have multiple options to schedule a PR merge:

- `/schedule`: The PR will be merged at the next sharp hour (e.g., 13:00, 14:00), based on the current UTC time.
- `/schedule 2024-11-19`: The PR will be merged at midnight (00:00 UTC) on the specified date.
- `/schedule 2024-11-19T12:50:00.000Z`: The PR will be merged at the next sharp hour immediately following the specified timestamp (e.g., if scheduled for 12:50 UTC, it will merge at 13:00 UTC).

You can find an example [here](https://github.com/owid/etl/pull/3563).

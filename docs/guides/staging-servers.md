## Data Manager Workflow

Dedicated staging servers are automatically created from every ETL pull request. That gives data manager the ability to share and test their changes before they are merged into the live site.

!!! note "PR staging servers URLs"

    You can visit your PR staging server at `http://staging-site-<branch>`. Note that `<branch>` might differ from the exact branch name, for example `feature/123` will be `feature-123` (all symbols are changed to dashes, and the maximum length is of 50 characters).

    For more details, refer to the [python code](https://github.com/owid/etl/blob/master/apps/staging_sync/cli.py#L284) generating `<branch>` from the branch name.

Once the PR is ready, data manager should merge it into master, wait for deploy process to run ETL with their updates and then migrate all charts to the live site. This has to be done within 7 days after the PR is merged, then the staging server will be destroyed.

    participant PR as Pull Request (ETL)
    participant SSB as staging-site-branch
    participant live as Live

    PR ->>+ SSB: PR Created
    SSB -->>- SSB: Bake
    PR ->>+ SSB: New Commit
    SSB -->>- SSB: Bake & run ETL
    PR ->> SSB: Merge PR
    Note right of PR: Schedule Destruction in 7 days
    SSB ->> live: etl chart-sync
    Note left of live: Sync all charts
    PR ->> SSB: Destroy server
```

## Creating a new dataset

When creating a new dataset, the manager creates a PR with a staging server and then creates charts on it. Once the work is done and merged, the manager should sync all charts to production.


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Local ->> Staging: New dataset
    Staging ->> Charts staging: create charts
    Staging ->> Prod: Merge
    Charts staging ->> Charts prod: chart-sync
```


## Updating a dataset

When updating a dataset, the workflow is slightly more complex. In addition to creating a PR with a staging server, data manager has to map variables from the old dataset to the new one in staging, which will create revisions. These revisions have to be approved then. After merging, running `chart-sync` would sync all changes to production where the charts must be approved again (or you could automatically approve them).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Local ->> Staging: New dataset version
    Staging ->> Charts staging: chart-upgrader
    Note right of Staging: Map variables from old to new charts
    Charts staging ->> Charts staging: chart-revisions
    Note right of Charts staging: Approve revisions
    Staging ->> Prod: Merge
    Charts staging ->> Charts prod: chart-sync
    Charts prod ->> Charts prod: chart-revisions
    Note right of Charts prod: Approve revisions
```


## chart-sync

`etl chart-sync` tool is used to sync charts from staging to production. It's gonna take all changed charts from the staging server and migrate them to production as either draft charts or revisions.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    box Staging
    participant NewChart as New Chart
    participant UpdatedChart as Updated Chart
    end
    box Production
    participant ChartRevision as Suggested Chart Revisions
    participant Draft as Draft
    participant PublishedChart as Published Chart
    end

    # New charts process
    NewChart->>Draft: New charts created as drafts
    Draft->>PublishedChart: Publish chart (manual)

    # Updated charts process
    UpdatedChart->>ChartRevision: Updates added as revisions
    Note over UpdatedChart, ChartRevision: Warn if chart has been modified in prod
    ChartRevision->>PublishedChart: Approve revision (manual)

    # Updated charts with revisions, useful for population updates
    UpdatedChart->>PublishedChart: Updates with approved revision on staging are applied directly (with --approve-revisions flag)
    Note over UpdatedChart, PublishedChart: Submit revision if chart has been modified in prod
```

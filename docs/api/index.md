# Public data API

??? warning "Our API is in beta"

    We currently only provide a python API. Our hope is to extend this to other languages in the future. Please [report any issue](https://github.com/owid/owid-catalog-py) that you may find.

Our mission is to make research and data on the world's biggest problems accessible and understandable to the public. As part of this work, we provide an experimental API to the datasets.

When using the API, you have access to the public catalog of data processed by our data team. The catalog indexes _tables_ of data, rather than datasets or individual indicators. To learn more, read about our [data model](../architecture/design/common-format.md).

Currently supported languages are:

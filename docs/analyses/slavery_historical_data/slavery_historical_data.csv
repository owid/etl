Switzerland,No large-scale forced labor since 1789,V-Dem,"Switzerland is covered by V-Dem only from 1798. Based on its expert assessments and our cutoff, there was no large-scale forced labor since then. Because the precise expert scores indicate that forced labor was rare at the end of the 18th century, and the founding of the Helvetic Republic does not seem to have changed [labor relations](https://www.britannica.com/place/Switzerland/The-Helvetic-Republic) much, we assume that large-scale forced labor ended before 1789.",
Syria,1917,"V-Dem, including predecessor state","Syria is covered by V-Dem only from 1922. Based on its expert assessments and our cutoff, there was no large-scale forced labor since then. Before that, it was a part of the Ottoman Empire, but there is a two-year gap in the data in 1920 and 1921. Because the precise expert scores are very similar before and after, and the years formed a [transition phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_for_Syria_and_the_Lebanon), we conservatively assume there was no major change then, and use the Ottoman Empire's end year.",

United Kingdom,1832,V-Dem,,"The [Slavery Abolition Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833) ended slavery in most of the British Empire, freeing [hundreds of thousands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833) from plantations and private estates.

[Additional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu#Arrival_of_Europeans_(1606%E2%80%931906)) [sources](https://www.britannica.com/place/Vanuatu/History) are unclear about the extent of forced labor in the late 19th and early 20th century.

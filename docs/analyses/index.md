# Public analyses

On this page, we publish technical reports on data projects at Our World in Data. These reports include methodology, replication code, and supplementary data or figures. They often support live articles on our site. You can think of them as the “technical appendices” to our research articles.

## Does the news reflect what we die from?

This analysis accompanies the article "[Does the news reflect what we die from?](https://ourworldindata.org/does-the-news-reflect-what-we-die-from)". It compares the leading causes of death in the United States in 2023 with the amount of media coverage each receives.

# Technical publications

On this page, we publish technical reports on data projects at Our World in Data. These reports include methodology, replication code, and supplementary data or figures. They often support live articles on our site. You can think of them as the "technical appendices" to our research articles.

This is just a sneak peek into some of our data work. But note that all our code is public, and you can explore our full data processing pipelines in [the ETL repository](https://github.com/owid/etl).

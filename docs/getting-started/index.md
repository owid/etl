# Getting started

The ETL is a key tool at Our World in Data (OWID) to ingest, process and publish data. This documentation is aimed at both OWID staff and the general public who want to learn more about our data work.

Making this documentation public is part of our commitment to **transparency** and **reproducibility**. We want to be transparent about how we work and how we produce our data. And we want to make sure that our work is reproducible. This is important for our users, who need to understand the data they are using, and for our contributors, who need to understand how their data is used in our work.

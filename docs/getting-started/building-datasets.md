!!! info "You will learn more about the structure and design of the ETL in the next [section](../../architecture/)."

The ETL is the way we ingest, process and publish data at Our World in Data (OWID). The ETL contains a set of recipes (or steps) to build datasets, which are then made available from [OWID's catalog](../api/). A step is a python script and has a URI. URIs allow us to uniquely identify any step (or node) throughout the whole ETL. This allows us to reference datasets (and use them) when building a new one. For example, the Cherry Blossom dataset (by Yasuyuki Aono):

*[URI]: Uniform Resource Identifier

```
data://garden/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom
```

## Build a dataset
### Preview dataset build
You can build any dataset in ETL using our [ETL cli](../../guides/etl-cli): `etl run` (or `etlr`). This will execute all the steps required to build a dataset.

Before actually building the dataset, it is recommended to preview the steps that would be executed to build it by using the `--dry-run` flag.

Let's preview the build for Cherry Blossom dataset:

```
$ etl run --dry-run data://garden/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom
--- Detecting which steps need rebuilding...
OK (0.0s)
--- Running 3 steps:
1. snapshot://biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom.xls
2. data://meadow/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom
3. data://garden/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom
```

!!! note "Activate your virtual environment"

    If you are not already, make sure to use these tools within your **virtual environment**.

    Details can be found in the [UV docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/), but if you have never used the tool before here is a basic usage that will get you started (this assumes you have been [here](../working-environment/#install-dependencies) and installed UV):

    ```bash
    # Install the dependencies defined in pyproject.toml and uv.lock
    make .venv
    ```

    Next you can use one of the following two methods:

    ```bash
    # Activate virtual environment. Once activated, you can use the tools here as normal.
    make activate
    etl run --dry-run data://garden/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom
    ```

    Or

    ```bash
    # Run a specific command in virtual environment. This will not leave you in the virtual environment.
    uv run etl run --dry-run data://garden/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom
    ```


The first step is a `snapshot://` steps, which when executed will download upstream snapshot of the dataset to the `data/snapshots/` folder. The remaining steps are `data://` steps, which will generate local datasets in the `data/` folder.

!!! note "`meadow` and `garden` channels"

    In the above example, you can indetify two different channels in the URIs: `meadow` and `garden`, followed by the same string `biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom`. These represent different levels of curation of a dataset (in this example, for the Cherry Blossom dataset version 2024-01-25 dataset).

    `garden` datasets are user-ready, whereas `meadow` datasets have not been curated enough to be used in production environments. We will explore these nuances later on.

    [Learn more about the ETL steps :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../architecture/workflow)

<!-- `grapher` datasets are very similar to `garden` ones, but with some adjustments to make them suitable for our Database, which powers all our site.  -->
Note that you can skip the full path of the step, in which case it will do a regex match against all available steps:

```
$ etl run --dry-run cherry_blossom
--- Detecting which steps need rebuilding...
OK (0.0s)
--- Running 4 steps:
1. snapshot://biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom.xls
2. data://meadow/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom
3. data://garden/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom
4. data://grapher/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom
```

Note that here there is an extra dataset listed, with prefix `data://grapher/`, as it matches the query (its URI contains the query text "cherry_blossom").

!!! note "`grapher` channel"

    The additional step listed with prefix `data://grapher` refers to yet another dataset curation level. It is very similar to `garden` datasets, but slightly adapted for our database requirements.

    [Learn more about the ETL steps :octicons-arrow-right-24:](../../architecture/workflow)


### Build the dataset
You can build a dataset by using the `etl run` command. This uses our [ETL CLI](../../guides/etl-cli) tool.

```
$ etl run cherry_blossom
--- Detecting which steps need rebuilding...
OK (0.0s)
--- Running 4 steps:
--- 1. snapshot://biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom.xls...
DOWNLOADED          https://snapshots.owid.io/fc/459738bd4a0a73c716755d598c6678 -> /home/lucas/repos/etl/data/snapshots/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom.xls
OK (0.8s)

--- 2. data://meadow/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom...
2024-02-26 13:55:17 [info     ] cherry_blossom.start
2024-02-26 13:55:19 [info     ] cherry_blossom.end
OK (3.7s)

--- 3. data://garden/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom...
2024-02-26 13:55:21 [info     ] cherry_blossom.start
2024-02-26 13:55:22 [info     ] cherry_blossom.end
OK (3.7s)

--- 4. data://grapher/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom...
OK (3.6s)
```

Let's confirm that the dataset was built locally:

```
$ ls -l data/garden/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom
cherry_blossom.feather
cherry_blossom.meta.json
index.json
```

Several files were built for the dataset: `index.json` gives metadata about the whole dataset, and the remaining three files all represent a single data table, which is saved in both Feather and Parquet formats.

??? note "Parallel execution"

    There's a flag `etl ... --workers 4` you can use to run the ETL in parallel. This is useful when rebuilding large part of ETL (e.g. after updating regions).

### Add the dataset to Grapher
Datasets are created and stored in your local environment `data/`. For the previous example, we created a grapher dataset, which is saved in `data/garden/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom/` directory. Now, if we want to create charts with it, we need to push it to the Grapher database. This can be achieved by repeating the previous command with the `--grapher` flag:

```
$ etl run cherry_blossom --grapher
--- Detecting which steps need rebuilding...
OK (0.9s)
--- Running 2 steps:
--- 1. grapher://grapher/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom...
2024-02-26 16:03:38 [info     ] upsert_dataset.verify_namespace namespace=biodiversity
2024-02-26 16:03:38 [info     ] upsert_dataset.upsert_dataset.start short_name=cherry_blossom
2024-02-26 16:03:38 [info     ] upsert_dataset.upsert_dataset.end id=6350 short_name=cherry_blossom
2024-02-26 16:03:41 [info     ] upsert_table.uploaded_to_s3    size=835 variable_id=819375
2024-02-26 16:03:41 [info     ] upsert_table.uploaded_to_s3    size=831 variable_id=819376
OK (4.5s)

--- 2. grapher://grapher/biodiversity/2023-01-11/cherry_blossom...
2024-02-26 16:03:42 [info     ] upsert_dataset.verify_namespace namespace=biodiversity
2024-02-26 16:03:43 [info     ] upsert_dataset.upsert_dataset.start short_name=cherry_blossom
2024-02-26 16:03:43 [info     ] upsert_dataset.upsert_dataset.end id=5864 short_name=cherry_blossom
2024-02-26 16:03:45 [info     ] upsert_table.uploaded_to_s3    size=833 variable_id=540251
2024-02-26 16:03:45 [info     ] upsert_table.uploaded_to_s3    size=1087 variable_id=540252
OK (3.9s)
```

Note that in this example, also the Cherry Blossom 2023-01-11 dataset was pushed to Grapher (it matches the query "cherry_blossom"). The dataset is now available in the Grapher database, and can be used to create charts.


### Run ETL in a specific environment
ETL steps are executed locally, but when pushing them to the database we can choose which database to use. This can be controlled by environment variables, which are set in an `.env`-like file. For instance, we provide [an example file](https://github.com/owid/etl/blob/master/.env.example), which should be adapted to point to the desired environment. Then, you can run any step like:

```
ENV_FILE=.env.example etl run cherry_blossom --grapher
```


## Reading a dataset

Now that our `data/` folder has a table built, we can try reading it. We recommend using our library `owid-catalog`. You can load the complete dataset using the `owid.catalog.Dataset` object:

```pycon
>>> from owid.catalog import Dataset
>>> ds = Dataset('data/garden/biodiversity/2024-01-25/cherry_blossom')
```

We can access the metadata of the dataset by using `Dataset.metadata`:

```pycon
>>> ds.metadata
DatasetMeta(channel='garden', namespace='biodiversity', short_name='cherry_blossom', title='Cherry Blossom Full Bloom Dates in Kyoto, Japan', description='A historical time series of peak cherry blossom bloom data from Kyoto, Japan. The timing of peak cherry blossom is linked to weather and climate factors. Warmer weather, due to climate change, is pulling peak cherry blossom earlier in the year.\n\nYasuyuki Aono compiled this data based on multiple sources:\n\n      - Taguchi,T.

```

### Exploring dataset's tables
This dataset may contain some tables:

```pycon
>>> ds.table_names
['cherry_blossom']
```

which you can then explore further:

```pycon
>>> tb = ds["cherry_blossom"]
>>> tb
              full_flowering_date  average_20_years
country year
Japan   812                    92               NaN
        815                   105               NaN
        831                    96               NaN
        851                   108               NaN
        853                   104        101.000000
...                           ...               ...
        2019                   95         95.699997
        2020                   92         95.300003
        2021                   85         94.750000
        2022                   91         94.750000
        2023                   84         94.050003

[835 rows x 2 columns]
```

We can see that this dataset provides two indicators (`full_flowering_date` and `average_20_years`), reported by country and year, which are the primary key for this table. Note that this particular dataset, only contains data for Japan. The object `tb` is an instance of `owid.catalog.Table`, which is a wrapper around the well-established `pandas.DataFrame` class. Using these custom objects (from our library `owid-catalog`) allows us to enrich the data with metadata.

You can explore the indicators

### Exploring dataset's indicators
Now that we have a table, we can explore its indicators further by printing their corresponding metadata

```pycon

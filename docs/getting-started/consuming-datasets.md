Now that our `data/` folder has a table built, we can try reading it. We recommend using our library `owid-catalog`.

You can load the complete dataset using the `owid.catalog.Dataset` object:


```pycon
>>> from owid.catalog import Dataset
>>> ds = Dataset('data/garden/un/2022-11-29/undp_hdr')
```

We can access the metadata of the dataset by using `Dataset.metadata`:

```pycon
>>> ds.metadata
Dataset(path='data/garden/un/2022-11-29/undp_hdr/', metadata=DatasetMeta(namespace='un', short_name='undp_hdr', title='Human Development Report - UNDP (2021-22)', description="The 2021/2022 Human Development Report is the latest in the series of global Human Development Reports published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) since 1990 as independent and analytically and empirically grounded discussions of major development issues, trends and policies.\n\nAdditional resources related to the 2021/2022 Human Development Report can be found online at http://hdr.undp.org. Resources on the website include digital versions and translations of the Report and the overview in more than 10 languages, an interactive web version of the Report, a set of background papers and think pieces commissioned for the Report, interactive data visualizations and databases of human development indicators, full explanations of the sources and methodologies used in the Report's composite indices, country insights and other background materials, and previous global, regional and national Human Development Reports.

```

To load the data as a table run:

```pycon
>>> tb = ds["undp_hdr"]
>>> tb.head()

We can see that this dataset provides several indicators, reported by country and year, which are the primary key for this table.


The object `tb` is an instance of `owid.catalog.Table`, which is a wrapper around the well stablished `pandas.DataFrame` class. Using these custom
objects (from our library `owid-catalog`) allow us to enrich the data with metadata.

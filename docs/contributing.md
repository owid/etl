# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Our World In Data!

Since collecting and republishing data is part of an editorial process for us, we do not accept contributions of new datasets from the public. However, there are still a few ways you can contribute:

- You can try to build our datasets yourself and verify that they build cleanly
- You can [report issues](https://github.com/owid/etl/issues) you encounter, either with our code or with our datasets
- You can try using our [API](api/index.md) to access our data and give us feedback on it
- You can [make suggestions](https://github.com/owid/etl/discussions) for important data sets that you think would add a lot of value to our work
